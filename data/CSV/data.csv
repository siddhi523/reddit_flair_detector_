AskIndia,[askindia] My brothers bank account was hacked this morning,40,dacmel,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dacmel/askindia_my_brothers_bank_account_was_hacked_this/,66,"My brother received bunch of SMS this morning around 3AM information debit card transactions on his account.

The transactions drained his account with 40K balance to 0

He reached out the bank, and going to the police. Has anyone been in this situation, what we can do to recover money quickly. 

Any advice is highly appreciated

BTW this is in Bangalore",prtthrowaway," I ll copy paste one of my previous comments-


According to RBI's guidelines, the liability falls on your bank if the fault is of 3rd Party that is neither you nor the bank, but only if you inform within 3 days. So, if it's not your fault then it doesn't matter what the manager has to say about recovery. If they can't, then also they will have to bear the burden.

For your reference, point 6(ii) in attached pdf

Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic ... - RBI PDF

https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/NOTI15D620D2C4D2CA4A33AABC928CA6204B19.PDF

>Third party breach where the deficiency lies neither with the bank nor with the customer but lies elsewhere in the system, and the customer notifies the bank within three working days of receiving the communication from the bank regarding the unauthorised transaction.

Were those withdrawals cash withdrawals? If yes, then you have a stronger case because the card was with you and thus fault must lie within the system/bank.

Also point 9 and point 12 are extremely important-

>9) On being notified by the customer, the bank shall credit (shadow reversal) the amount involved in the unauthorised electronic transaction to the customer’s account within 10 working days from the date of such notification by the customer (without waiting for settlement of insurance claim, if any).

Burden of proof.

>12) The burden of proving customer liability in case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions shall lie on the bank.

My opinion: You must inform everything to the bank in writing and you must get a receiving. After doing this, you should ask them for the resolution. If the resolution offered by them is not optimal for you, then you should show the bank RBI guidelines and put pressure on them. Which bank is this? Has he used the card or account online? What was the mode of transaction?
Is a simple money transfer or money is used to buy any goods ?

Share the SMS with us. Did he activate and use  internet banking facilities with the hacked account? Always keep international transactions for the card disabled. Enable only when you need to use it. Phishing scam, probably entered his card details at a fake website page some time back. These transactions are usually carried around midnight in India during weekends, they don't require OTP, even a front and back picture of your card will do. Could be that he gave his card to swipe at a store and they stored his info and sold it later. You will never know, you won't be able to trace the transactions as it takes place outside India. Transaction usually takes place in small batches of 2000-5000 rupees and to buy things online mostly. 

But since it is axis bank, your brother might get your money back. Stop using cards online or even offline, use cash or UPI. From my experience, you should raise the issue with the bank and ensure you block the card. 

A piece of advice I would give to all people who use cards online is to use credit cards because the protections offered are way higher and it is also easier for banks to block fraudulent txns. This has happened to me also, I got a call trying to confirm a txn worth 50K on my CC, told her to block the card, they sent a new card and txn was never allowed to go through. Banks usually call you if you spend >25k at odd times or through not so know portals. Only once you confirm do they allow the final charge. The exact same thing happened to me a few months back,in Bangalore.
Had to file a complaint with the cyber police and then show the fir to the bank to get my money back. Took nearly 5-6 weeks for the money back tho.
This was a huge scam that affected a lot of people at the same time actually.
It probably happened due to this thing called ""card skimming"".
If you're not fluent with kannadiga, always get someone who is,when you go to the police station.I did that and got the work done in 2 hours which otherwise would've taken 6(I was asked to wait that long initially)
Hope this helps Lot of such cases recently....they get access to your phone no. Connected to bank...deactivate it and connect a new one and withdraw funds

Can I answer? 

...yeah, she's the only one. Nevermind. You need a serious tag here First I'll say it obligatory that I'm not attractive.
People keep staring at me wanting to engage or strike a conversation. but I'm an introvert and like to keep to myself. Not to be immodest or self gratuitous but its kinda weird that people stare at you in envy or maybe thats just me. Ok so not great looking and stuff, but I did become significantly better looking after losing weight. I'm told I'm ""cute"". It was a world of a difference with regards to my confidence and peoples perspective of me.

People treat me nicer when I'm thinner. I've been on dates with some very pretty girls and all round excellent human beings with interesting backgrounds (models, actresses, chefs, entrepreneurs etc.) Being more attractive than my past self has gotten me more attention and positive interest for the most part. People are also less harsh with their first impression of you. I'm not that good looking that people envy me, so yeah there's that. My friend is great looking.

So he gets a lot of female attention in general ( nature , you know )

He was in 2 or 3 platonic relationship ( wow ) 

Lots of crushes

Gets his work done ( from his admirers of course )

But still he is down to earth and humble. People just stare continuously, it's very very annoying, but I just learnt to ignore and pretend as if nothing's happening.

I feel bad for girls, They have it much much worse. Physical looks of a man don't matter much if it's not matched by confidence and certain badness. It's a mixed bag, you get better treatment from women in general and you end up having a few crazy girls with crushes on you etc. And some guys will absolutely hate you because you will make them feel insecure about their looks.

Also I have had gay guys do everything from pinch my bum to ask me to do a line of cocaine off their cocks. Nothing against homosexuals but their approaches are by far the creepiest."
AskIndia,Why do Indian doctors have such a large ego?,123,d41pq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d41pq6/why_do_indian_doctors_have_such_a_large_ego/,120,"Some context: (We're Indian in India), My parents, especially my mom has not been doing well for the past decade. She's diabetic and has taken very little care of herself.We had one specially bad experience with pyelonephritis while the three of us were in a small town, with poor facilities. I found the doctors lacking in treatment strategy and nurses painfully lacking in terms of discipline (they would make up temperature readings instead of waking my mom up and dutifully measuring her temperature). We then had similar experiences at one more renowned hospital(mostly with nurses, not doctors) 

Because of this my dad I've generally been proactive when it comes to understanding diagnoses and have always seeker more that one opinion and asked questions relating to treatment based on research. Mind you, we never self medicate. 

Our most recent experience has been heart related. My dad had tightness in his chest (he's had a small history) and an angiogram revealed he had a couple of blockages. 


The doctor recommended getting an angioplasty done. My online research indicated that more tests(ffr and cardio ultra sound) could be done to ascertain any real need for stents. I then took my dad's file to two other doctors who also recommended getting more tests done(the angiogram cd wasn't available at the time). 


As a result of these additional opinions and my own research I had my dad postpone the angioplasty and ask to conduct these tests. 

Upon hearing this the original doctor blew up and scared us by saying he wouldn't be responsible for any mishaps and asked us to promptly get discharged. this obviously scared us. 

He expressed annoyance at my suggestion to get more tests done saying it wasn't necessary. I'm not contesting that he knows more but for someone who's willing to pay the additional amount for these tests i don't see why we shouldn't take them. He clearly took offence to my suggestion. 

The final paragraph captures everything that bothers me :I did my research, got other doctors' opinions and asked to conduct more tests. It's not as if my dad was self medicating. I wasn't even asking for an alternate treatment (like homeopathy or some bullshit of the sort). I've seen this sort of reaction ALL THE TIME and patients really have to be careful about not stepping on eggshells when talking to their doctors - WHY? 

why can't patients ask their doctors questions?

Aren't Indian doctors trained with the softer side of dealing with patients? 

If not shouldn't they be?

EDIT:Guys, i didn't use simply my research to jump to conclusions. That would be idiotic. I'm not putting my dad's life at risk based on a Google search. I used it to merely understand what's possible and understand what my original doctor told me and the other doctors suggested.

EDIT2: all the doctors agreed on a minimum of one stent. The original doctor wanted to go ahead with a second stent for the 2nd blockage without using ffr, which is where the doctors disagree.

EDIT3: We'll be getting an angioplasty done ASAP and tat a hospital where an ffr would be available for the 2nd blockage. Thanks all!",hb4100," Here’s the simple answer:-

1. Echo is to determine Cardiac output and anatomical abnormalities(valvular). It can be used in the setting of An MI or stress testing, if there are baseline history of ECG changes.

2. Angiogram is the considered the gold standard for determining whether to stent, angioplasty, or do nothing. This determination is based on amount of obstruction, number of obstruction, location of obstruction and Comoros factors.( diabetes...)

3. ECG changes are temporary unless permanent cardiac muscle damage has occurred(heart attack). They are usually reproduced with stress testing on a treadmill to check. But subside after.

I can’t say whether your dad needs a stent or an angioplasty or nothing. I need a complete h&p + lab results. But it seems to me that the first doctor is right. Your dad needs an intervention, it seems like he might even need an open heart procedure not just a stent. Depends g on his current health status. Your answer is that we as a profession don't in fact have a large ego, you just had a bad experience.

>I found the doctors lacking in treatment strategy and nurses painfully lacking in terms of discipline

I'm sorry you had to go through that, where did this happen?

>The doctor recommended getting an angioplasty done.

Which tests had been already done?

>My online research indicated that more tests(ffr and cardio ultra sound) could be done to ascertain any real need for stents

This is where the problem is. Do you really think that 20 minutes of online research counterbalances years of training? If it does, please, by all means, let's abolish the medical profession altogether! 

>As a result of these additional opinions and my own research I had my dad postpone the angioplasty and ask to conduct these tests. 

I'm not saying that you should believe what your doctor says blindly, do research, take second opinions, but do you think you have the authority to just ""have"" your dad postpone an angioplasty? Don't you think you should've taken your researched material to the doctor and asked his opinion instead of giving your own inexperienced one?

>Upon hearing this the original doctor blew up and scared us by saying he wouldn't be responsible for any mishaps and asked us to promptly get discharged. this obviously scared us. 

Though the doctor's reaction was highly unprofessional, it was totally accounted for. Your father's condition could've worsened due to your amateur diagnosis. I think that the doctor would be more than happy to discuss your research with you, but it's no surprise that he got pissed that you took such a great risk by using research on the internet, (where BREAKING NEWS Anyone can write) to come to a conclusion. 

>I've seen this sort of reaction ALL THE TIME and patients really have to be careful about not stepping on eggshells when talking to their doctors - WHY? 

Doctors are supposed to behave decently with the patients. You don't have to be careful. Again, if you'd only printed out your research and taken it to your doctor, he'd not need to freak out on you.

>why can't patients ask their doctors questions?

>Aren't Indian doctors trained with the softer side of dealing with patients? 

>If not shouldn't they be? 

My diagnosis of this post is that you've only met doctors with crappy personalities. You can answer the doctor questions, I personally take special question-answer sessions with my patients. It depends on where you are. If you come to Mumbai, you'll have lot better treatment and doctors with much better personally than those shitheads you met. I was quite hurt by reading the title of this post itself. I'm not saying that such doctors don't exist, but it doesn't mean that ONLY such doctors exist. Please don't generalise a whole profession based on a couple of personal experiences. Here's my two words.  


1. Angiography is the Gold standard for the coronary artery diseases. If your result is positive in angiography, you don't need any other tests. Period. There is no point of debate here. Angiography results are absolute.  

2. My dad was admitted back in march, The doctor in charge of my dad was working from monday- thursday without going home, in the same shirt. He looked exhausted. He used to sleep in the hospital. This is the current working conditions of doctors in India.   
If you are contesting a Doctor's 8+ years of medical education and years of experience over 20 minutes of internet research. You are wrong.   

3. Additional tests are not just about money. It is also about the doctor who has a tight schedule and surgeries of a lot of people other than your father. If everyone wants him to take additional tests and listen to their queries, he won't be saving the lives he should be.  

4. Also, maybe you are right, that Doctor might have flipped out unnecessarily, but that might be one case. Generalizing a whole profession is going a little overboard. Your problem is more with the industry than doctors. A few of my relatives had been in private hospitals in the past, and they told me that many are literally curved to prescribe expensive procedures and medicines.

The hospital you go to is really important. In my experience, Bombay Hospital is usually very fair, and do not over prescribe. I believe we've limits on how much empathy we are capable of on any given day. It's worse if we don't get proper sleep. I've seen docs with saint like bedside manner go off on families of patients at the end of a long day. I'm not saying it's justified, but he's just another human being. Also, medicine is not a perfect science. Different docs practice it differently based on their experience. To me it feels like you just got your ego hurt. Generalizing an entire group of people is a dick move. I have a doctor in the family, and being a curious engineer, I probe quite often to understand how my body works.

Trust me, don't try to self diagnose. The amount of training that these sad buggers go through for 10+ years can in no way be condensed into a Google research. Ya you, smart guy, you don't know shit about your own body. Spend all that time and research in finding a well reputed good doctor, hopefully through reference. Ok maybe I am exaggerating a bit, it's good to know about your condition, but if a good doctor says something else, they are most likely correct.

Suck up your ego, because when it comes to a professional like a doctor or a lawyer, I don't mind the most ill-mannered asshole doctor if s/he is the best in the business. I am literally handing over my life into his or her hands, not hanging out for coffee. I believe you've just encountered a bad egg. I've met doctors who are happy to answer any question no matter how probing. No one can stop you from getting a second opinion, so don't hesitate to trample on some egos to do what's best for your father's health. To add to /u/pms1712 

That physician was unprofessional.

Vast majority of physicians in India have God complex. I am sure a lot of physicians are driven by financial motivations, just like any other profession.

Physicians in India simply do not have time to have detailed discussion with patients due to the volume they have to see, both in private and government hospitals.

Frequently, and quite commonly in cardiology, the patient's degree of symptoms obviate the need for further testing.

Finally, people in India derive whatever pleasure from trying to shame and put down physicians. You are not alone. Physicians in India are used to this. Good luck. Their egos are dwarfed by the egos of their receptionists Here's the other side.. 

Imagine being a doctor. Say you have worked for at least 5 years and are experienced enough to be in a reputed hospital.

Now if a guy comes to you *after* going against treatment prescribed by you and if the guy's expertise is solely internet search, wouldn't you be pissed off? Forget doctors, any professional would be pissed off in such circumstances.

Add the pressure of working so many cases, add the fact that it's a heart related disease, his outburst is probably justified. He might have been having a bad day and went a bit extreme but his actions are not unjust.

In fact, I have seen many doctors saying ""you can get another doctors opinion if you feel like."" even before the treatment starts. Keep doing more online research and you'll diagnose yourself with cancer and the prediction that you'll die in 3 months.
For once can you trust in doctors than your own Google research.
If you would have asked him politely as to WHAT those tests are for, he would have replied. Also there is a time when you approach a doctor with your issues. If a doctor is handling an important case and emergency management and then you go and ask your doubts, they'll obviously get pissed of. Ask at a time when he seems a bit free or in a calm state.
Blaming the whole profession for a doctor's mistreatment is also wrong.
You could have taken a second opinion from your family doctor. [deleted] I wish I could become a doctor, it's too late now, life sucks, kill me I am not sure where you are based. I am unfortunate enough to have numerous medical conditions in my family and therefore have lot of experience with the Indian medical system. 

Both my mother and MIL are cancer patients and they were treated in Chennai Apollo and Fortis Bangalore respectively. We found the doctors to be utterly humble, helpful and actually took time out to answer all our queries and address every doubts. I have really high regards for doctors based in Chennai and Bangalore.

My father has Parkinson's. Untill last year he was being treated in Kolkata (where we were staying untill recently). Our experience was horrible and would never recommend to get any treatment in any of the hospitals there. We found everyone to be rude starting from the receptionist in the clinic to the doctors. Everyone carried an attitude. The doctors kept getting irritated if we asked too many questions.

Later I moved my dad to NIMHANS and I could never have asked for a better experience. People were professional and actually cared. NIMHANS is a govt sponsored institute and the efficiency was surprising.

Hence, I believe it actually depends from place to place. What i could glean from your post is 

You had a bad experience with your doctor. I agree he perhaps shouldn't have flipped out but pushed you harder to reconsider. From his point of view, cardiology is a profession where delayed intervention can cause lots of problems and and it is also the profession with more chances of being sued.

Also did the other doctors see the results of the latest angiogram as you wrote in your post that you didn't have angiogram results at that time?? If yes what did they comment on that?

As others have mentioned Angiogram is a gold standard. Cardiac USG shows output and fill rate but you can't pinpoint arterial blockage even with doppler and is unnecessary diagnostically after an angiogram.

So kindly don't delay. Treat major coronary artery blocks as quickly as possible. Taking a second opinion is not wrong but do not delay. Ideally try and take more time with your consults to clarify all your doubts. If the doctor does not want to clarify your doubts or dismisses them then I do suggest changing doctors. Ah yes the weekly doctor bashing post. ""Online research"" LOL we didn't study 10 years just for some guy to randomly google shit and tell us how to treat someone. My in-laws are doctors so I'm usually spared any of the pain patients usually have to go through, but I feel you. 

The problem is that patients, especially poorer patients and those from rural areas, treat doctors as Gods. I've literally heard patients call my MIL ""bhagwaan"" for treating minor issues.

This can get to your head over time

Also, because most patients tend to not have a lot of education (remember:you are a minority in India), doctors aren't used to their opinions being challenged, especially by lay people Your observation resonates with mine and the answer is simply demand - supply. One patient's disconfort is statistically insignificant when there are thousands more per each of you who treat him as a literal god. Same reason when a guy tries to fight you instead of being sorry when you ask them to stop pissing on the walls. Getting caught red handed is hella embarassing. 


Ps. If it's a Fortis hospital specially in Noida get him out of there ASAP. I feel, indians expect their doctors to be arrogant, if not then they themselves in return don’t trust the doctor. This is our own cultural gift to ourself.

Additionally, lately webmd doctors add a lot of issues for doctors. Their second and third opinion will obviously irritate an educated doctor. Imagine whatever it is you do that your cousin walks in and tells you that they did a YouTube course and are better than you at making that decision. Play that one in your mind to see how a doctor will feel, specially when lives are at stake.

Lastly, from personal experience we are also a culture that will take multiple opinions to get one that feels closest to our own judgement of the situation. My mom will not get her knees operated, every 6 months she finds a new doctor that recommends medicine over surgery. By the 6th month that doctor identifies surgery and she drops them. Came across your post and it seems your first doc was right. A blockage in the LAD ie left anterior descending is very dangerous. An angioplasty should be performed. 

I’m not trying to condone the behaviour of the Doc you went to but just to give you some perspective patients many times do not heed to doctor’s advice and end up doing more damage to themselves. One of my uncle’s recently died coz of this. He had chest pain and went to a hospital for that. The ecg was normal but his doc asked him to be admitted in the hospital for a day coz he had a previous history of MI. Uncle didn’t listen, self diagnosed himself to have “gas” , ate a pantoprazole tablet and slept. He had another episode the very next day and died on the way. 

You see a doc has no way of knowing if you have done proper research and more often not even the time to deal with many patient queries especially if it is working hours. I know it’s not ideal but it’s just the sad reality that people in healthcare sectors are overworked. I have had terrible experiences with doctors too but I wouldn’t generalise everyone to be egotistical crooks. 

I hope your dad and mom are doing well. People are not a monolith. 
My doctor suggested to get several tests from a particular lab, but I went to a different lab. When I showed the report, he didn't liked it. He accepted the report only after getting the trst done from that particular pathology lab. Upar se suna alag dia bc....


Another case with my in-law, she was also specifically told to get the report from the very particular hospital. The doctor refused to do further treatment, just because she didn't follow the instructions.

About certain tests, which needs high tech modern machines, which are with few labs and hospitals, their recommendations are understandable. But for simple test ?? When you are seeking treatment of doctor you have to trust him man instead of your own internet research . Doctors get offended when patients think reading few internet articles give them more authority on what to do than them who have practiced for years . Isn't everything thing about experience s? We are to blame. We equate doctors to God in India. [deleted] Even many Indian doctors in America come here with that same piss poor attitude. The doctor might be a few stents away from a fully paid Singapore trip. That's one of the reasons he might be desperate to get a stent in. But you should still take second opinions from other doctors and follow their recommendation, a few hours on internet doesn't make you a qualified medical professional.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Help me deal with an asshole tenant,81,cq5tzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq5tzw/askindia_help_me_deal_with_an_asshole_tenant/,27,"Background: I rented my house to friend's acquaintance after a referral; he was a decent working guy with two kids. Since I repainted the house a week before and he needed a house for just a year; I did not put clause to painting cost of the house in the agreement, how much damage you could make in an year right!?

Fast forward to one year: **The agreement ended in the Feb 2019**, he stayed in the house until end of the May 2019, **without paying rent for three months**

And his kids thrashed the house completely. There was crayons scribbles everywhere, mud everywhere, even adults drew rangoli on the wall!

Now: I told him, I will deduct unpaid rent, the cost of painting, and to fix broken things from the security deposit. The guy is acting like complete asshole, locking the front gate and not returning the keys to the house, until I repay the security deposit in full!

I am replacing the locks to the house, consult the lawyer.



What are my other options? I don't really care about the money at this point, all want is the guy to pay for the damages.

Edit: added missing details

Edit 2: here's few pictures https://imgur.com/a/H6BPXLC",prashantvc," Never let a tenant stay even a minute beyond the lease date. No matter how well you know the person. This puts you and your property at immense risk incase things turn sour.


Security deposit is kept exactly for these situations- damage to the property. Furthermore, the rent for the time he has been living should be adjusted from the security deposit. You need to involve a paper trail ASAP. 


Involve the police and send him a legal notice if need be. First priority should be to get him out of the house. Police should help out here. But vamilies don't trash rented places. Only vaachalars do.

Hope you have taken pictures of the damages. Discriminate against bachelors more. ""Decent guy with 2 kids"" lol I hope you're not in Bengal cause the West Bengal Tenency Act leaves you no room to manoeuvre . Best i suggest is either cut off electricity/water/supplies or go to the local thana. They'll make a call and that sorts out most issues. Or tell any police friends you might have to call and threaten them on your behalf. He doesn't really have any standing . Do not get dragged into court no matter what!!!

Good luck Not an expert on this, but just get a cop in there? [removed] I think the interest on the security deposit alone would be enough to make up for the lost rent :) He cannot legally lock you out. Lawyer up. 
Also ditch that friend who recommended this guy."
AskIndia,[AskIndia][Serious] Is it worth attempting immigration to Canada/ Australia for 1.6lpm-ers in India?,55,c4ilk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4ilk5/askindiaserious_is_it_worth_attempting/,115,"Title. 

From what I understand based on armchair research: 
Motivation to immigrate: better future life for children in terms of clean water, air, education
Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism? 

Experienced immigrants/ those who are in similar shoes, please share your thoughts",aashish2137," NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn’t as high paying as the US. But it’s offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It’s a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you’ll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They’ve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] [deleted] Yes, it is."

This situation deals with where more empowerment should be given but also up to what extent the limits lie in what one side can and cannot do.

EDIT: This isn't about a man hitting a woman or starting the fight and arguing with a woman. This question deals specifically about a man being shamed, humiliated, belittled or being spoken to condescendingly by a woman who was simply bumped into accidentally and has a bad temper or is accusing him wrongly or extorting money or some sort like this.",NobleCandleHolder," Run for your life. 

Aint nobody gonna listen to what you are saying once these wannabe heroes see the lady shout/yell/cry. Get the fuck out of the place. The biggest risk here is mob mentality. If you hit a woman and are not a local goon, people around you will beat you up pretty brutally.

Typically it is best to keep calm and keep defending yourself, block out the heaviest blows, endure the lighter ones. Keep in mind, blocking does not entail grabbing them, that makes things worse. Try not to fall or take heavy blows to the head. 

If they are not bare handed and have a weapon or anything that can be considered a weapon, run or hide behind other people. When you bring another bystander in the fight, they'll try to help you solely to save themselves.

Quick note, make it a habit to apologize clearly, loudly, quickly and repeatedly whenever such a situation arises. Try to avoid such things. But anyway, these things are easier said than done. GTFO  at any cost . For some strange reason Indians are obsessed with  Mob Justice , The Man would be thrashed brutally even if he's not at fault  ..and some nut job would shoot a video to get famous on SM ..so just run like Usain Bolt ..🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ You back off...  Saw this at a traffic junction where a woman tried cutting her scooty through 2 other 2 wheelers driven by men and was scraping against their wheels..  They honked and called out (a bit rudely, but avg for roads I think) , ""Dekh ke!""(Pay attention\\look out) . She took off her helmet, turned around and started screaming ""Aurat se baat karne ke tameez nahin hai kya?"" (Dont you know how to talk to a woman?""). My cab driver told the guy to just back his scooty a bit and not confront the woman, the girl pointed at the cab driver and told the biker ""Aise baat karni chahiye "" (You should talk like this) *Andi mandi shandi, jisne mujhe chua, uski maa* We can't really do much other than staying away from the conflict. There are tons of ""White knights"" trying to gain that validation and sense of being hero.

Just try to calm things down,because Indians are really nosy as is,they'll jump to conclusions and it all goes to crap really fast The best way for a man to handle a situation is to calmly walk away. Call your vidhayak chacha. Lower the intensity of quarrel if you can else start leaving/running from there ASAP. Many wannabe heroes on the street will come to support the woman and beat you up. Man , this may be unrelated but it hits home with me what you just wrote.

So here I am driving my i10 on the road, and these 2 women on a scooty just slipped towards my driver side in front of me , and despite my honking and even telling them to let me pass , they just drive like this.

Now, they were unfortunately going to the same colony as my home, so naturally they felt like I followed them. Once they stopped , I stopped my car parallel to them and rolled my window to let tjem know that they were driving like idiots , blocking the road, to which they started shouting. Unnecessarily shouting. Blaming me for driving recklessly and also harassing them ( wtf? ).

So , lucky me, my house was near, I just drove off. 

I was on a lookout for them , as they were also visiting the colony , they may do damage to the car if they spot it . 

One of those tense evenings.

Lesson I learnt is - just get the fuck out. Unless there's CCTV footage, men are always assumed to be in the wrong. This feminist BS apparently means women are equal to men, but not in specific situations. You'd do well to steer clear of women who are looking for scapegoats. Look up jasleen kaur, my man. Retreat quickly while apologizing profusely. Take a deep breath. Take out your phone and start recording. It's tough. It might not be practically possible, maybe this comment would be instilled in someone's mind and they use it in a similar situation in future. Having said that, you need to be extra careful with the phone, it could be easily snatched away. Oh god tell me about it, arrived at Mumbai airport and there's this spot where you enter inside a wide elevator with your luggage trolley. This LAYDEE bumps INTO me and starts yelling at me for not moving. I was the first to enter the elevator and was placed my trolley faaar behind. She kept yelling and I kept ignoring her, thankfully I had my headphones on so that made it easier. This is precisely the reason why I have anxiety when it come to having a conversation with women, all my life I've been shot hateful looks, condescension, and even an occasional shouting for something normal as just initiating eye contact or sitting next to in a bus or a class. That's why I run in the other direction as soon as I see a woman coming my way without making eye contact. A dumbfuck underage school girl broke a traffic signal, gets on the wrong side and hits my bike. I broke my wrist and front forks of my bike were ruined. A fucking asshole comes running and shouts at me ""Dekh ke nahi chala sakta kya?"" and then the crowd starts to gather around. They pick her up, dust her off and give her some water. Meanwhile *I* am asking someone to *help* *me*.

Nobody gives a fuck really. And I had to pay for the damages. Fuck that Bitch. Get away from there if you can't don't try argue and inflame the situation even further because an angry mob is not going to listen to you no matter how rational or logical your complaints are. You can take legal action later if the matter is serious but at that time saving your life should be your first priority. run away start video recording , hide your face and then remove footwear and run Just say sorry and back off. If she wants money, give her some. Who's right does not matter, who has power matters. And in the case of false complaints, women have infinite more power than men.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Think of it this way, even male police will be hesitant to deal with women in areas where rule of law applies...  how much power do you have as compared to a policeman? If you feel like that there's no escape left, then play a higher moral card. For eg. say to them that you want to call police. Ain't nothing wrong in calling police and that will also shut up their crazy ass. If you're chances are lucky, you might get a reasonable police personnel. And you can just gtfo that situation. Have seen it happening in metro and people did not side with everyone rather I had diecord against one women others sided me even other women..... So it depends if you act all innocent and manage to sway people to be on your side..... Scream ""how can she slap?"" Calmly reason, ask questions to expose the woman's drama, or act dumb yourself, or reverse the allegation and claim that the woman wants to extort money. Keep it between you and her, if anyone from the crowd starts getting involved too much, tell them to shut up unless she is their relative. Calm, assertive but prepared to fight. All this works well if you are bulky enough, look like you belong to a good family and won't take unnecessary shit. [deleted] lmfao, what the actual fuck Don’t quarrel in public - duh"

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",11,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!"
AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,38,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,33,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",24,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,30,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Cingari, Cengar or Tzengar?",0,18ntue,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/18ntue/askindia_cingari_cengar_or_tzengar/,0,"Hello,

I submitted this to /r/rAskIndia a week ago but got no answers. Perhaps some of the good people here may help?

I was reading on the origins of the Gypsies and found this statement:

>Among the castes of India, there is a group called the cingari, cengar or tzengar, which means the most humiliated of persons and it is believed that they are related to the Roma.

([source](http://www.grahamstevenson.me.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=694&Itemid=54))

The information there is quite old (I traced it back to at least 1878) and I find it a little dubious. Is - or was - there a group so named?

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,106,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair."
AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,5,63l6vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63l6vm/who_should_i_vote_for_in_2019_general_elections/,50,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",concernedindianguy," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself."
AskIndia,"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"".",2,9b5g5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9b5g5p/so_i_am_writing_a_book_titled_ironically_letters/,4,"Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

AskIndia,[Shower Thought] Subsidies and cheap favours by political parties make people happy enough to vote those parties most likely because people have low standards due to poverty.,23,6voqzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6voqzs/shower_thought_subsidies_and_cheap_favours_by/,15,"Think about it.

Not sure if it's the same as your thinking, but here's an article about how farm loan waivers don't help in the long run. Helping everyone is the best way to get votes. We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on.

Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

",Bikihuigormint," BJP has learnt a lot from the humble onion, narratives on narratives and the core, nothing. > Nobody gave India confidence! 

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt. 

 
 FFS all these chutiyas complaining about India's ""weakness and impotence"" are so clearly projecting their own shortcomings.

India managed to stay ""non-aligned"" under severe pressure from both US and USSR under Nehru. We were able to stave off handing over economy to the World Bank and IMF for as long as we could and when he opened up, we did it on our terms. We engaged in 4 wars and came out on top in at least 3.

We lifted more people out of poverty than any other country except China and corrected social injustices like untouchability which had existed for centuries.

And all of this while being a functional democracy, empowering civic institutions and fostering an inclusive multilingual, multicultural society.

How on earth - can someone say that is weak? If your family thinks this is any sort of accurate or well articulated I fear for their intelligence. Just a hypocritical NRI bhakt ranting about things he is  too lazy and selfish to change himself.  So many similarities between our new dumb entitled middle class and the hypocritical nationalist nris."
AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,46,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Isn't that trolling? Shouldn't your post get deleted as this is Reddiquette flaired? Non-political. Why can't this just be 'Others'? Thank You. This was very helpful.  > Scheduled: For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week.

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you. 
And as /u/immediate_cock mentioned, Lift, Lift and Lift more. i think you are not asking the right question to right people. i mean i doubt sehwag sir is a member here ?

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".  

Cliched line, but since you are afraid of her rejection: Be a man.

Theres nothing of the sort in the pvt sector. Are you in a govt job?  Go Heisenberg style.  Dude you sound defeated , chicks dig confidence .

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not.

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",throw_for_bea," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc."

AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,6,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",mdocvar," When you said “Parents in India” I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.

AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",7,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",rajasthaniConfused," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years."

AskIndia,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,159,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  "

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?"

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active? How dare you?

.. you're probably right -_- Anyone want to take over /r/wtfindia? > /r/bakchodi - active

BTW, I am open to the idea of welcoming mod(s) to /r/nashik. I just made it to park it, but unfortunately haven't gotten around to actually write stuff up.

AskIndia,[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,29,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!
",i_am_not_sam," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

> About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal 
attack? Yes.** 

What the fuck? May I know when are you going to ban words like ""kulcha"" and ""kulcha warriors"" ???  Thanks for the change.  > New link flairs to be introduced -

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

What will be the criteria to select this shortlist? Thanks for the link flairs! That was required. 

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well. 

 >New link flairs to be introduced -

Old article (older than 6 months)
Technology (phone reviews)
Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)
Finance
Twitter
Sports
AskIndia

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,52,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon. 

---

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",r_india_mod," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts. However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.

Thank you for this :) Add a bakchodi flair for posts like [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3eiy7w/i_got_this_kind_of_spam_first_they_make_me_bhaiya/) Just wanted to complement you for the Ask India flair. It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.
I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

:D - Much needed! Can we get an '**International**' flair ? why misleading? why would i mark my own posts as misleading? Great!! Thanks for the speedy implementation! The flairs that you chose are great and will definitely help! However no call on the pol threads? >Regular - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers.

What is RDD stands for?? Random Digit Dialing!?? Can you guys change the colour for AskIndia flair? [deleted] short cuts for mobile users? > Ask India - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India[1] community.

 I only have to say one thing .It seems from the eg /r/india mods put up like we Indians only care for sex and shit , there are tons of eg to put up. This doesn't look .. well good especially on a stickied post of most subscribed Indian sub.

AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,75,3de8cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3de8cn/modpost_new_flairs_for_rindia_and_improving/,234,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",r_india_mod," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.   

What is low-effort? [Lame] for worthless discussions going on here.

AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,85,3wcid0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3wcid0/bill_gates_thoughts_on_climate_change_and_indias/,10,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”


[Full interview here](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/11/we-need-an-energy-miracle/407881/) It's worth a read. ",running_flash," You liked what he said? Twit to him and let him know about that. Bill Gates is an admirable brilliant character, unlike his late counterpart in another company. You know who... What if there is no renewable technology that is cheaper than coal? Should we say ""oh well, the free market didn't solve it, therefore let's all die in 60 years"". Carbon has a cost; we will end up paying it one way or another.

And obviously the west should do more. The biggest hurdle to combating Climate change from the West is the republicans that still in denial mode. And the powerful oil+gas lobbies. I wouldn't be surprised if their money funds cutting nuclear research, and many anti-nuclear activists.

It's kinda sad that he considers China a developed country that should be taking the lead on climate change and India a poor developing country, but that's reality I guess.

It's also important to remember that The Atlantic caters to a US liberal audience who are hugely upset by the climate denying crazies in the American right - India's problems are a distant concern. But to us in India the pollution levels are WORSE than China, so we should do more than be complacent. Throwing our arms in the air and going ""the west needs to fix it, not our problem"", is ultimately self-defeating.

But yes of course, the West needs to share renewable research and help out developing nations too."

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

Subash Chandra founder of Essel group which includes Zee News, is a MP from Haryana with support from BJP in Rajya sabha. I respect people like Kher more than Amitabh Bachchan, at least we know where their loyalty lies.

Amitabh has been a Cong MP in 80s.

Then was close to Amar Singh and SP in later 90s and early 200s. Wife is still SP MP.

Became close to Modi when he started to rise.

Now hearing he's going back to cong as we speak.

 Ambani bhool gaye Sudhir Chaudhary - Zee TV. Prakash Raj - Congress  Prannoy Roy, Barkha Dutt, Rajdeep Sardesai and Sagarika Ghose - all Congress  i have been curious about this. most americans openly identify with one of the two (mostly) political parties... i wonder if it means that they are officially a member of that party or they just prefer them over others... it would have been nice if this was the case here as well. would have been easier to decide who to avoid and who not to looking at how things are here in this country.  Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all.

Non-Political,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,1600,8gwqi3,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,207,,imacrazydude," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos. This is how anarcho syndaclisim works people  [deleted] Mumbai Meri jaan unreal
 Is this a Photoshoped image ? I honestly find it had to believe but if true. Wow the wonders!  This is so nice.
 That's very Non-Characteristically Indian Same thing I saw in Mumbai a few days ago. Glad finally people are adopting this. /u/DNA007 :) Wow! Welcome to New India.  Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? 😯😯  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is. It is impossible . looks like they renovated borivali When people start building a whole railway station on their own without any corporation help, I'm not amused when they start standing in queues.

(non-political)",15,8ius6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8ius6e/rant_do_we_deserve_what_we_have_or_do_we_have/,8,"Ok, so my classmate from school got a new Mercedes S class. She or her parents didn't buy it, her fiancé gifted it to her. **What does he do?** He acted in a flop movie, his dad owns businesses. **What does she do?** She is jobless since her graduation. Her dad is a lawyer I think, (not sure). But I wouldn't say her family income is significantly greater than mine. For all I know, it might be lesser. At every point in time, I worked my ass off. She, not so much. She's got some rich dude now, and suddenly her life has upgraded a million times.

After a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.

I know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?",killerdrama," There are guys who marry for job/wealth and stuff as well. Life is unfair if you compare yourself with others. You gotta do what you gotta do. Idk who even told you life is fair. Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.

You're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn’t owe you anything. Life doesn’t have to be fair, life doesn’t have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don’t, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don’t get a hot pile of shit in return. C’est la vie. "

In this **Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “objectionable part” which “arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans **…” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …” **Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.”

Non-Political,[non-political]My solution(s) for Whatsapp forwards causing havoc.,0,8wr0y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8wr0y2/nonpoliticalmy_solutions_for_whatsapp_forwards/,9,"1. Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob (This will be easy to implement as people never edit the message and just keep forwarding it.)

2. If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people and only allow them internet when they are properly educated about the norms and ethics of being on internet (Why not under a national program like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas; This type of **""Vikas""** is in dire need)",sangar-happy," > Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message

Thats such an Indian way to deal with anything, end all solution - ban, though it may not be effective.

> which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob

This would also require Whatsapp, the organization to track each and every message being shared on their app. At the moment, it has end-to-end encryption.

> If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people

Who is going to implement such bizarre solution on the ground.

Will the government come up with public-private participation issues licenses for internet fitness test?

And does the education you speak of, stops at one point?

As far as I know they are hosting an entire event based on the hashtag, it wouldn't be long till people start screaming the hashtag around couples who just want to spend some time together. 

This just feels weird.

Edit : #PyaarEkDhokhaHai translates to #LoveIsBetrayal
Mostly targeted towards singles who are frustrated about not having a date for Valentine's.",BacchaYadav," Yep, yet another ""let's get viral"" tactic, looks like.  It was ok at first but now it feels forced. Tanmay Butt if you're reading this, tu sannyas le bhai.  World is coming closer to Black Mirror day by day!
Episode: Hated in the Nation I agree.

I don't mind the hashtag, but the event and all is stretching it. It just sounds kinda stupid and weak to me. Bhaiyya toh kya samjhe ki youtube pe intellectuals milenge?  Unsubscribed from AIB's channel a long time ago, quiet happy. [deleted] I'll happily debate anyone who says PyarEkDhokhaHai

Because I've experienced the opposite What does PyaarEkDhokhaHai  even mean?? Mediocrity sells and AIB are doing a good job at it . Guess now they are the Salman Khan of YouTube. Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It’s just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.  Please tell me it is just a joke and not an actual event that people are attending.  If someone provides the translation I can also decide to outrage.  To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.    
   
I'd also like to ask everyone calling them the personification of mediocrity to give me some examples of good Indian brands in the content space.  Can anyone fill me in on what it's about?


Also ,fuck AIB, mediocrity personified. They're finally living up to their name, in a literal way. they have sponsors. Don't take this shit seriously Can we stop having self derogatory memes until a point people seriously start believing it and trouble/judge others if they talk about having a better experience?   

I mean, I have never dated hell I am shy as fuck if I need to approach a girl but I know it will work if I want it to work and try to make myself a decent human being. I don't even get it. Is it supposed to be ironical? Sarcastic? Commentary on regressive society? AIB is still a thing? Finally somebody said it!! Hosting an entire event on that is just too ridiculous. Atleast screaming the hashtag around couples seems like a fun idea to me."

Can’t really ask her to go on a date or something because we both are day scholars and this is a town in india we’re talking about.

exactly, thats what you'll be: a tampon, learnt that the hard way, quit her in 2015 after getting tired of her back and forth bullshit and uncertainty, she ll keep you locked but she wont say say, fuck that shit man, no one s got time for that... She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? 

",finalbeer," Send the Port message. They will immediately call you. I had this problem a lot. I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS’s undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had “no politics” and would remain “devoted purely to cultural work” (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel’s pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi’s January 30, 1948 assassination**.

> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government’s demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed “**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past…**”

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the “**objectionable part**” which “**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans …” Further, “As a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji …**” Patel said people’s opposition to the RSS grew when “**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji’s death.**” Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don’t remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that’s grounds for dismissing the leadership? So, complain to Sardar Patel? ;)

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life.

",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans’ awareness of the Company’s conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and “despotic” empire . Following the Revolution, America’s connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

Non-Political,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,35,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,10,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
",Responsbile_Indian," I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]"

 1. Indian consumers dont care about quality.

2. As someone who travels frequently for work in India and abroad, I have observed enough times to know that Indian tourists and travelers are, in one word - impolite - to travel with. And this is true for all sorts of transport. 

There will always be exceptions to this but they're few. Almost negligible. 

 Indian girls are the worst for dating and fucking. Like they are confused between wanting a boyfriend and a husband and an ATM.

Somehow if you are a lady, you automatically get some privileges. And if you protest, people think you are a rapist or a molester.

Religion needs to be stopped from turning us back into 5th century. Slam poetry in India is shit and serves no purpose whatsoever. Upbringing of indian kids have gone shit these days. 

The amount of shitty responses you get on r/india just confirms my suspicion. Parents are raising entitled pieces of shit and it is going to bite them in the ass. indians are becoming like china, we are copy pasting same news article,same form of movie plot,pranks even music style! we don't give 'TIME' to do some research and make a innovative content specially on the internet. I support the complete legalization of prostitution. Sex workers need to be taxed and there should be welfare schemes that provide health care and assistance.  I want non gays to be non gays and dont pretend to be gays because its hip. US media is heavily seasoned with subliminal messages which makes you think that being straight is a crime. P.S I dont hate gays they should be free to exercise their rights."

Wonder how many of them on the map are fake. Aahh.. An urban-dweller's dream come true They are having an n-some That is some really shitty experience.

Even though you have a 100 cars, just keep a limit on how many cars you want to show on the app.

Expectation Setting : The road is literally filled with cabs. You will get one in like a minute or so. 
Result : Still get a cab that is 2 kms away or more than 10 mins away. Well that's just the weekly ola orgy being carried out in peace Bangalore is the only major city in the country where you can  park pretty much where you want.  I don't think I've ever seen cars being towed or asked to move off any road here.   Just curious, what is that place on the right where they have a shitload of cabs? I used to live in that neighbourhood 4 years ago. There were zero normal cabs. The times, they change! Why does it say Indra Nagar near Jakkur? Better than Uber I think, got an Alto 800 today in Uber. I'm 5'9"", my colleagues are 6'2"" and 6'. It felt like solitary confinement in there. [removed] And despite the shit load of cabs present, there is not a single TFS cab.

It's always the case, the 6 Rs/Km cab is a myth. that's what is called a cluster fuck I really, really, really like this image.  You're lucky that a cab is in your area. My area is quite away from the main city and most of the time there are no cabs in the area. One time I had to go to the station and I couldn't find one, Uber saved the day (but with 1.4x price surge). It could be entirely possible that most of them are on their way somewhere else and hence showing on the map?  The Ola Centipede Now I know why traffic is so bad in Bangalore.  Seen something like this on BTM last Saturday morning around 11 AM. It was still 1.5 times, waited for some more time it became 1.3. Then i saw TFS car and booked it immediately without any surge pricing. 

I use OLA a lot, have been to cars couple of times when driver said it is their first day in OLA.

 Food, music, architecture & language...Urdu is the finest example...Amazingly beautiful language...

>what were negative aspects of the Islamic invasion of India?

Islamic invaders went a few step beyond greek invaders...they destroyed temples , religious & educational institutions, they forced conversions literally & by deceiving & by luring with financial gains...There were moderate Muslim rulers like Akbar (Which I agree is suspicious)...some say that if Dara Shikoh was not killed by Aurangzeb, India would have been a different place right now. Poetry,Urdu,food,architecture and design,first set of roads,pigeon telegrams,jagirdari was abolished in some areas,established, developed and fortified hyderabad and delhi as a state of wealth and power,introduced jizya and zakat to elevate the poor.

Negative - Forced conversions in some places - jizya was exclusive to non muslims,internal fueds which killed a lot of people,wiped out most of the rajputs

This is from a debate i had in school...vaguely remember some of the stuff now. From an earlier post - (old thread removed). /u/piacious

>good: food like biryani, kebab,samosa et all. music like sufi genre, architecture, literature . social system changed for better for a bit .

 Violence and Intolerance. Nothing. Babaji ka thullu Lot of positive things. Land records are even today maintained using persian/muslim system. Even in south india, which saw less muslim rule. The official language of administration of even sikh emperor ranjeet singh was persian.

Notice how ""muslim"" portraits of hindu kings like shivaji look? Thats cultural influence.

Lots more that are not well known. Purda is obvious, but thats more negative.

I have an offer from a startup which pays higher than the current engagement, but since neither is core, my parents aren't very supportive.

Pls advice",Bikihuigormint," I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?

From my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.

The most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?

My background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.

Then I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking ""why?"" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.

This is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that. But you are the one who has to live your entire life on those decisions. Why not make an informed, well-thought one? Understand the future prospects of those professions, what you want with your life, and which one aligns the most closely with your ambition and desires. Best of luck, OP."

[R]eddiquette,Planning for the Election [R]esult Coverage,68,256ue2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/256ue2/planning_for_the_election_result_coverage/,106,"**Exit Poll Discussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25cpsw/mega_thread_exit_poll_results_discussion_thread/**

In light of the upcoming coverage of the election results (both real and exit) we believe the following would be the best way to cover these elections at /r/India:

* On the evening of the 12th (5pm IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the results of the various exit polls. 

* On the morning of the 16th (8am IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the actual results of the elections. This thread would contain the link to two separate threads - one for the results of the Lok Sabha and one for the results of the state legislatures that are going to poll. 

These threads (the exit poll thread, and the thread for results of state elections and lok sabha elections) would be created by /u/megathreadbot (same bot which helped us out in covering the assembly election results in December 2013). Any user would be able to add updates to the body of the text post. 

The threads would be [R]eddiquette enforced and no name calling / personal abuses will be tolerated. All news items related to the election results should go in these threads. Please don't create separate threads for them. This will help in consolidating the discussion in a single thread. 
",rahulthewall," Can we attempt a new experiment?
Anything that is even remotely abusive or gets into name calling...delete that post outright. No warning nothing. /r/askhistorians level cleanliness. In that case we need a parallel sticky thread on /r/bakchodi dedicated for name-calling and uncivil debate.. Any sane comment should be immediately deleted and the user suspended..  Can we have a live thread/chatroom too for unadulterated shit-flinging and name-calling? Can we have the upvote and downvoted sign as the Congress' hand?! That'd be fun for a few days. [deleted] Excellent. This would prevent the flood of posts on the result day.

Please remove posts appearing multiple times, or else other posts will get buried. What's an election thread without name calling / personal abuse?  Better make 5 threads, one each for North, west east south and central India. Just throwing in suggestion. We need a SLEDGE thread a day before along the lines of /r/Cricket  A page created by Bing tracking election results: http://www.bing.com/elections

Share this also if needed. >On the evening of the 12th (5pm IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the results of the various exit polls

its 5:25 where is the thread????? Can we have a dedicated Sledge thread....Anyone who wants to be abusive or  have some fun, can go here :)

I thing this will make things easier for everyone. Basically we are giving everyone what they want.

Have a link to this thread on top next to the reddiquette message  Anyone interested in charitable bets like /r/CharitableBets but for election results?

Like you could bet on range of seats of a party or the winner of a particular seat etc? Election Result will be available live on 16th May @ http://www.recruitmentvartha.com > The threads would be [R]eddiquette enforced and no name calling / personal abuses will be tolerated. All news items related to the election results should go in these threads. Please don't create separate threads for them. 

This is yet another conspiracy by the leftist psuedo liberal commie mods to stifle the celebrations of BJP and Modi ji's grandest victory ever. ^/s

I'm actually not sure about the /s, to be honest.
 Exit pool results for the concluded elections will be on CNNIBN on 10th 5 pm. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag.

[R]eddiquette,"AMA Announcement: Rahul Yadav, co-founde[r] and CEO at Housing.com - Tuesday, 19th May 6PM IST",241,365xqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/365xqh/ama_announcement_rahul_yadav_cofounder_and_ceo_at/,180,"**AMA LIVE HERE**: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/

---

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.

**Verification**: http://i.imgur.com/T9uPJow.jpg
",AwkwardDev," I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! 

I'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. 


Also, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:

1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. 

2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?

3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?

4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?

5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?

6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif I have a very genuine question for Rahul, hope it doesn't get moderated.

Rahul, what do you smoke ? how much do you pay for it ? and how many times a day do you smoke it ? You got Rahul- oh. Never mind. Awesome, 
this will gonna be awesome, but it will attract a bunch of rubbish media.  Monk who sold his ferrai? Or the monk whose driver refused to drive unless he gave away his ferrari We are so lucky to have few out of those precious ~3L working hours he is left with! After doing all these stunts.. Do you sleep well? How much do you sleep? **Do you even sleep?** Because I have seen you post on facebook early in the morning at 4 A.M. or 5 A.M.... Your situation is like *""Raaton ki neend gai, din ka chain gya.. kya hota hai ye klook[up] klook[up] klook[up]..."" ???* He is in his chappals btw in that verification pic. :D

edit- No offence meant. Calling Deepinder. This one would b an epic AMA ! I think he'll do a U-turn in the last minute, skip the AMA and flip the bird to all of us. Lets do bets...how long before MSN/ Clickbait sites pick this story up & which one will be first...winner get a puppy people get oil and frying pans ready ;). let me leave now to buy a pack of popcorn :) Going to be a nightmare for the Grammar Nazis. Remind me to login at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot It's always wise to firewall port 22 on your production servers

 Looks like he is preparing for CAT, photo me left me ek sample paper jaisa kuch hai! How much credibility would you give to IIT tag in raising VC at insane valuation? How did you feel when you realised for the first time that you've only ~3L hours left?  Bhai, IST bole to stretchable time hai kya? 6 to baj gaye! Has the AMA started? How do we use this reddit AMA firstly? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?** 

Please be as candid as possible.

 Its happening here guys - http://ss.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/ When does this start??
 Tell him to get some lube.  This is going to be fun! *Marks the calendar* *Rubs hands in glee* What about Rahul Baba?  There is a lot of confusion in the ecosystem right now, everyone is there with his/her own opinion on the recent events. It is now time we actually hear one side of the story in first person. I am having my college exams and you know engineers study at last moment still I am gonna attend it. I signed up just for this one AMA. No matter what he says, there's going to be roughly equal number of people who admire him, and those that make fun of him.

Sorta, kinda like AK or NaMo. This is one to watch out for, for sure! He's the Balotelli of startups. ♪ Yeh to hona hi tha ♪ But...but...are we worthy? Remind me to here at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot I hope he stops behaving like his other namesake in politics. It is a great opportunity to get to know his part of the story. I just joined in reddit to participate in this AMA :)  Who would you say has inspired you the most and why? Do you consider yourself successful? Is there more to housing.com than VC money? GUYS BRING YOUR ALTS WITH THE MOST FUCKED UP USERNAMES I hope this session dosent turn into a ROast  [removed] Let the games begin! Just got a reddit handle for this  This is going to be fun....waiting :D 30 minutes to go. Let's see what unfolds!
 Let's say I were to cruise up to your local bar with my IIT D t-shirt. I sit down at the bar and order an overpriced old monk. I grab the remote from behind the bar and change the channel to Roadies. I strut over to the jukebox and play some Linkin Park and ask your old lady for a dance.

How do you feel about Digital India ? What you would be doing. If you leave Housing.com Where is the ama going on ?! what will be your next kick? r u a salman khan fan?? Did you just kept thinking to get an idea or u just got it one night in dreams?
How do you find people with same level of enthusiasm as you for an idea? Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who has done commendable jobs in their fields. IF your resignation was not a publicity stunt what was the reaction of Mr. Shailenra and other board members over your letter? Hey Rahul,
How you are able to take such big decision in very short time? can we start?
 give some tips on your digital marketing campaigns according to me they are huge i mean you are everywhere on the internet (housing.com) Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who had done commendable jobs in their fields.   Are you planning to open housing office in Seattle?
Just curious because my current home is having water pipe burst...:-) when will you enter into the sf and give a kick to us startups?
lets play a story telling video on the home page instead of static html pages
bull shit?? What does Rahul have to say about the comments comparing him to Arvind Kejriwal? Nice. Say what you want about his behavior, he has been more successful than 99% of the people on r/india. Looking forward to the AMA. This looks like 100% PR stunt... Rahul, are you Rakhi Sawant? don't rediquette tag the AMA  The best thing about this is that he is going to literally Answer Your Anything... Interesting...

I get calls from random people asking for my mobikwik code to log in
 Would love to see if Mobikwik users discuss the scam their cashbacks are. 50% of the times they would not give you automatically. You complain and you get 40% of them after a few hours. 10% are never delivered and are basically denied with some or the other excuse. Dumped them. Moved to PayU and Paytm. Instant cashback. No hassle payments.  Excited to ask him about their plans of adopting NFC.  Mobikwik claims:
MobiKwik offers payment by credit card, debit card, net banking, and even cash pay

However, Payment by Cash is NOT available. It may lose credibility by such false statements. y don't you provide better affiliate programming? Last month it was good. This month it has changed. Not able to add money by american express CC, And mobikwik support team is giving me silly solution each time I raise ticket. 
 For American express payments sometimes I receive message saying that ""we are sorry for the delay, we are processing your request"" Mobikwik payment gateway is not able to handle this and doesn't work anytime. This is a permanent issue. Please look into it without giving common solution. Interesting. >independent member of parliamentYea, independent just like Vijay mallya.  Or Anil ambani.Any ""independent"" person who gets into rajya sabha of all places, is not to be trusted.This guy is a niira radia waiting to happen.

[R]eddiquette enforced.",Mogaji," As pointed out by dexbg; there isn't a bifurcation known as political defamation.

Understand that civil and criminal defamation are the same thing in essence;  civil defamation is a concept under tort law; which in India is not codified, meaning there is no Act or written rule for torts but  criminal defamation falls under S 499 of the IPC which is a codified law.

The main difference between Civil & Criminal proceeding for defamation is pertaining to compensation. While the object of Civil action is to adequately compensate the person defamed for the loss of reputation by damages; the object of Criminal prosecution is to punish the offender by way of imprisonment of fine or both.

 What do you mean by political defamation ?

Defamation is defamation, the intent & action matters whether political or not."

There are a few very intelligent leaders unfortunately brainwashed or subjugated by the Gandhi dynasty.

AAP:

Its cadres, if not its high command, genuinely want to change India for the better, but don't understand that the way the AAP goes about doing it is not the right way. Congress: Has the most experience at governing the country, boasts of some highly qualified politicians. May be also most acceptable party right now. In case of BJP, people are either on an extreme yes or an extreme no. Congress, on the other hand, does not face such devoted and extreme hatred for whatever reason.

AAP: basic idea of such a party is great, some really passionate people have joined the party with true intentions. Whether they'll be heard or not is a different matter I think Rahul is good at heart. Not the brightest, but a nice chap. If he was a normal dude in my circle, we'd probably hang out and have beers on weekends. He'll also amuse us friends with his space analogies.

This is also not getting much news coverage.  

This sort of thing is the reason why India and China haven't resolved its border dispute Because India can not resolve it.  

China has resolved All of its Land borders in a 3 decade blitz. Except India and Bhutan(which is also because of India)  

India can't even get to terms with Bangladesh and it took 40 years for India to enter negotiation with a neighbor like Bangladesh in 2011 on the border issue.  

PRC settled those 12 borders and only 2 times got about 50% of original claimed land, rest were all around 5-20%, meaning it gave land concessions on Every deal and it settled because PRC leadership and the other country both had Govts/Leadership which were either totally Authoritarian or partially.  

India has not had a single party majority Govt since 1980's. This is the real reason why talks have not gathered momentum because India can't do anything even if it wanted.

> * People like Bhagwati believe we should concentrate on  economic growth and the poor will ultimately be helped; whereas, if you concentrate on other things, growth might suffer and as a result, so will the poor. In that chain of arguments there is a dual process. One is that high growth means more jobs. So if the poor have more jobs, they will have more income. Two, if there’s growth, the economy expands and taxes go up.

> *  With that money, you can fund anti-poverty programmes. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument. But it doesn’t always work. For instance, even in the highest growth period in India, **say between 2003-08**, most of the evidence shows that employment didn’t grow much.

Here is [Livemint's Claim Check](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html) on the topic:

> Who: Narendra Modi.

> Where: At a rally in Rohini, Delhi.

> Check: Modi is right. Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, there were 60.7 million new jobs that were created as against 2.76 million new jobs between 2004-05 to 2009-10.

This illustrates how ""growth"" and ""development"" are not isolated and dead unlively numbers but on-the-ground impacts. How in the relatively low growth 5y period of NDA rule, they were able to add fucking 57 MILLION more jobs than the UPA in a *high* growth 5y period!

Scheduled,Will India (and our highly questionable work culture) benefit from a 4 days working \ 3 days weekly off schedule?,170,drbswn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/drbswn/will_india_and_our_highly_questionable_work/,124,"This experiment has been adopted intermittently in many parts of the world across many companies - recently it found huge success in Japan at Microsoft:

https://soranews24.com/2019/11/03/microsoft-japans-experiment-with-3-day-weekend-boosts-worker-productivity-by-40-percent/

I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?",PuneriPerson," The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done. Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

Long story short: In Japan, employees are still a key human resource. In India, they are an expendable tool. Many times we have to work on weekends anyways. Can't think why that will change. And it won't matter if your clients work 5 days a week. Your opinion doesn't matter. [The decision has already been made](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/govt-avoids-fixing-minimum-wage-in-draft-rules-suggests-9-hour-working-day-11572758439316.html).

> The Indian government has suggested a nine-hour normal working day in its draft wage code rules, but has stayed away from fixing a [national minimum wage](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-minimum-wage-won-t-fix-india-s-woes-1565619815429.html). 

> 26 days of work in a month

Which basically means 6 days a week.

So yeah, go fuck yourself. The Government has already decided 6 days a week, 9 hours a day for everybody. Bhai middle managers won't let this happen. Mandated 5 day work week would be a start. Apart from MNCs and few central government offices, everyone else works on Saturdays. also what would be the secondary effects of this move - as participation in hobbies, skill growth, lower commute \ traffic congestion - shall all have largely stimulating advantages in the overall environment. 

I am fascinated by what the results of such an experiment will be if implemented on a controlled, small scale. I think India would better benefit from more Work-from-home options. For example, come to office twice a week and wfh other days, especially in congested cities like bangalore. Now even Saturday and Sunday leave is a problem. Either you have to work om weekends due to some emergency or they load you with so much work and such deadlines that you end up working on weekend. If we deny the manager will say even we went through this or we will be simply released as there will be 1000s ready to work on saturday and sunday. Talk about negative competition. population (s)explosion That's like taking 3 steps at a time. First jobs need to be 6-8 hours long 6 days a week. Generally people are given ""work from home"" even on Sundays. Not to mention people work till 8 when they were supposed to be home by 5 or 6pm.

CREATE A HAPPY ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE WILL WORK BETTER. > Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?          




LOL. I was recently ghosted by a startup for letting them know I wasn't comfortable with their 6 day a week schedule (Monday to Saturday, every single week). Read on if you're interested.  

________________

**Back story -**

I recently interviewed at a startup for a tech role (Data Scientist) and was going through the final so-called ""cultural fit"" interview. I have almost 3 years of experience in the field. I currently work at a startup that works Monday to Friday (40 hours a week).   

Just doing my due diligence, I asked the interviewer if they work on Saturdays. To my disappointment, he said they do. Now, this was my 5th interview round. Not once did they tell me about their Mon-Sat schedule. I only got to know because I asked. 

For some context, this startup is 4 years old, have their product out in the market and have close to 30 employees (their claim - I was never invited to their office and all interviews happened on the phone in the course of a single week).   

As soon as I heard of their 6 day work schedule, I was disappointed. I mean, coming from a startup background myself, I understand the kind of hard work people need to put in every once in a while. Working on Saturdays during emergencies and other critical events is perfectly fine, but every single week? Come on! 

Oh, and I also would get **no** equity for my work there.  

But working on weekends wasn't necessarily a deal breaker to me. I just wanted to put myself in their shoes and know *why*. 

I mentioned to the guy upfront that my current organisation works 5 days a week, and that my life is built around a Mon-Fri schedule so it will be difficult to adjust to a 6 day work week.    

The guy must have realised my disappointment (this was on the phone), and so he started talking about how much potential this company has for growth and how much I could grow with the company. 


Anyway, I wanted to ask them their rationale for working every Saturday the next time we spoke, and also to evaluate for myself whether sacrificing my social life and hobbies for a job was worth it. 

Coincidentally, this conversation happened on a Friday, I got a text message the next day (Saturday), saying ""Let's close this today"". I had a long week and I switched off for the next two days and I didn't respond until Monday. I apologised for the delay, saying that I took some time off for the weekend and was ready for a discussion.    

That was it. I never heard from them again. I never said no to working on Saturdays, but still they ghosted me. I guess they wanted someone who would be submissive and not question their wisdom. 

Which is a shame, because the product (from what they told me, seemed interesting) but some of my friends say this was good riddance. Part of the problem is that our labour regulations and enforcement is, mildly put, absolutely terrible. Looking at indian labour laws is a crash course in the necessity of updating laws to new circumstances and the need to discard old laws in an expeditious manner rather than just getting by on the courts desperately trying to make the woefully inadequate laws fit the needs of today.

Even in sectors with massive deficits of required workers (such as medicine and law), the actual worker holds little power since regulations are lax and there's no one powerful actually standing up for them. A doctor or lawyer, especially one that's just starting out, will universally work long hours at the cost of his health; not because he's easily replaced, but because his managers are, for the most part, so inept that it would be tragic if it weren't hilarious. The iron law of wages is evident here for most to see.

Now how this can be remedied is a task in and of itself. It starts right from said horribly convoluted and loophole riddled regulations to the rather asinine practices of promoting professionals to managerial positions based on their ability to do their original job (a good doctor or lawyer isn't a good manager or leader) and linking payments to said promotions (which forces said professionals to seek such positions for better remuneration).

And yes, there's more to it than that, but the short answer is that the problem is very much systemic. This is as much cultural (if not more so) than it is economic. And that wages do not reflect demand or skill (otherwise we'd be paying the people who clean gutters more than any corporate CEO or hedge fund manager), they reflect status and power. 4 days working !! What a joke for Indian owners. I can see some of my friends are working on Saturdays also. Also, some are happy with their alternative Saturday holidays. I am sure as The sun that India will never implement this type of formula. Even government will do, Private company owners they will never spend a minute to think about it. You talking about 4 days working last month I worked on 2nd October without getting extra pay !! It's not like I'm talking about small towns this scene is available in one of the Metro city in India and only officially declared heritage city of India :) Would never work with our work ethic. Already mondays and fridays half the day is gone in either reaching late after leave travels or leaving early for leave travel. I still know people working in 6 days week. Even I used to work 6 days few years back. Let's make a uniform 5-day work week first. Better to learn to walk before attempting to run. I don't think that would work out over here. We've got a pretty laid-back work culture as is. most of the work in India is about availability and not about capability , our work culture is a reflection of it ( in both public and private sectors ) , Being specific to IT companies we are mostly cost centres which do really little productive work hence the moment we go for a 3 day weekend thereby increasing cost , these jobs will be outsourced to a cheaper location. Also apart from the '**highly questionable work culture**' we also suffer from highly questionable work ethic , as employees some treat their job as time-pass activity  working as seat warmers. For these people a 3 day weekend is pointless.

3 day weekend boost productivity which is amazing for people involved in demanding profiles, for this strategy to work in India we will need to have jobs that involve R&D ,planning or designing  . The problem is this kind of work demands attention and critical thinking, something our newer generation is quite not trained due to being spoon fed in schools with meaningless grades and ignored by professors in higher studies . Hence the 2nd thing will be reform our education system which emphasises more on thinking and less on following. It will work only if the office remains open six or seven days a week and there are alternate workers for those days which others have off.

That will kill both the unemployment problem and improve worker productivity. Might work where creativity is given large portion of importance..

For labour , essential services like hospital , it wont work , as this will hamper production in case of industries , and routine work procedure in case of health care industry. Service-based IT companies have their heads up their clients' asses. Middle and onsite managers make unrealistic promises to clients and make their subordinates work like a dog.

Much of this behavior stems from keeping their bosses happy, which was prevalent even during previous generations. So, I really don't see this happening until the time companies choose to treat their employees with respect. Yes, but only if people stopped the casual chit-chat over chai breaks, numerous smoke breaks, discussing cricket/politics breaks, taking personal calls at work breaks, hour long lunches and so on. [deleted] [deleted] Will it benefit the people? Yes, Of course.  
Will it benefit the companies? In the long run, yes.

I'd like to bring on a few points here:

* Japan is a labour shortage economy, yet the country is so culturally driven that loyalty and long working hours is a norm. You will find a huge faction of the workforce working for their first company throughout their career.
* India on the other hand is a labour surplus, and that too at the number one spot. In short, if you don't want to work long hours, there are literally thousands who would.
* This was done by just one company, Microsoft, which isn't even Japanese. They just tried it as an experiment, and 'might' do it again in the future.
* In a report produced a few months back, Indians turned out to be the employees taking the least holidays in the world. Technically it was correct, but didn't mention the procedures, the unapprovals, the interrogation involved with leaves in India. With such an approach of the organisations towards employees where taking leaves is ""not caring about the well-being of the organisation"", there's little hope of 4 day work-week.

I am a Senior Manager- Human Resources in one of the top media companies, and no matter what the terminology is - Human Resource, Human Capital, Personnel, Talent, Pink Squirrels, HiPots - the companies (there are exceptions) know that unemployment rates are high and that they can choose to treat employees like robots with little to no consequences. I have worked in a 4 day shift model back in 2008 and 2009, we had to trade off weekends. My working days used to be tue, fri,sat,sun. First implement 5 days, 8 hrs/day properly. Forget everything else. Work from Home once a week NEEDS to be a thing right now. Work culture is bad? 

Are you fucking kidding me? We Indians are lazy and most of teenagers and college going students that I have seen are complete morons. Even the new job takers have no skill and no desire to sit and learn.

If you think this is 'bad work culture and hard' then you are simply WEAK. Learn to fight. There are people surviving with no resources and you can't even survive and thrive after getting an excess of monthly income?! Shame on you And lose all that sweet outsourcing $$?

No, thank you very much. I'd rather jobs stay here than go to our Asian rivals. Use some basic sense.

We are a growing country and need to constantly do so just to keep up with the population growth let alone generating enough GDP to life people out of poverty.

Now imagine the whole indian work force stops working for one whole day every week? Does not even bear thinking about.

Scheduled,Trains availability and schedule flexibility,5,dsf0wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsf0wr/trains_availability_and_schedule_flexibility/,7,"Me and my wife will be travelling for 2 weeks in India in mid December. Our route is (in that order): New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata and we want to use trains to move between them. On one hand it's safer and more robust to book everything online and not worry about the ticketing, but on the other we want to be flexible since nothing goes as planned.

What would you recommend? What's your experience?",5hrp," Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens. You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket. 

You can text me if you want more information about the places to visit or any help or have any confusion regarding these cities. Get the NTES app on your phone for live train status. It's the official app and it's good. Do you have a non Indian passport ? Foreigners have a quota in most major trains and you can purchase reserved tickets under this category from major train stations like New Delhi Railway station. It might be difficult to find seats in regular category on trains if you use the online route as trains get booked fairly in advance. Goodluck !

Why do we do that! Why do we try to see the difference in one other.

Why is there even an idea of someone being superior by their birth.

How can someone think they have more rights than others.

Animals are better than this. Government must compensate the family, the best it can. Life lost. Casteism at its ugliest. This country will not Change in a million years. I don't even duckin care anymore. Bloody hell. Casteism is one of the very important reasons why India is so low in HDI and various other indexes. This is why we need **caste based** reservations This is so fucked up and the bad part is this is very near to my village (about 30Km) in Punjab.And I don't think this is casteism . It's a pretty peaceful and safe area. RIP. I tweeted few days back saying how dalits and other minorities facing discrimination and this ""girl"" commented dalits are not minorities and she is a dalit and i am fucking stupid because dalits are hindu and they are safe. This is fucking digusting, whoever did this should be sent to jail. The deceased was jat Sikh too right ?

So I’m confused - I thought there’s no casteism among the Sikhs Pains me ! Why oh why be so bloody stupid. Casteism  is getting more and more deep rooted in society instead of fading with the progress of education ,job options ,other digital information sources .There is an increase of tensions between different castes even on slightest poking by any  miscreants ,Lots of abusing you tube comments ,videos,Facebook status ,Whatsapp forward will instantly start to make things more worst.Only God knows when we will be out of this shit of killing each other based upon caste hierarchy and rank .

No body have right to kill anyone when we as a human do not have power to make alive anyone. Was it a cast motivated crime? Yet, the UC in this country have the audacity to question reservations. WTF? Feudalism is still alive and thriving in India. In another world this guy would've been a supermodel or something. Such is the lottery of birth sadly :(. WTF is wrong with people in Punjab! Modi doesnt care. This is messed up Godse did not assassinate Gandhi, it was an accident, I’m told. People believe what they want to. 
But you have a point, and the prosecution will have to prove the casteism allegation. Regardless, it is a heinous crime and must be punished severely. I do feel sad
But was it necessary to mention that he was a dalit?

Is the nearby town safe at midnight for family?",Direct_Equivalent," I am assuming by car.

Unless you are like a real enthu astro/aero geek. I wouldn't recommend esp with family. More than safety, it will be very tiring, if you are trying to drive up and down in one shot.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

If its not cloudy and weather is good, a night launch is pure magic. I want the answers too. Do we need to buy a ticket or something? Heard from someone that you could buy tickets couple of months before the launch.

Have we ever had any dalit main characters in mainstream films **that were not about casteism or discrimination**? I'm talking about 'heroes' and 'heroines,' characters who would be played by the superstars and a-listers of their respective eras in mainstream, big-budget Bollywood films.

This question is prompted by *Dhadak,* the remake of *Sairat* in which they changed the caste of one of the main characters.",pagesindigo," Chachi 420.

Hero's surname was Paswan. Lagaan had a guy who could spin the ball but belonged to scheduled caste iirc. It's not played by some major actor tho. Newton Commenting again because I wanted to read the other replies. Ive seen newton and I missed any caste assertion in that.

Mukkebaaz has a character that is a wrestling coach of lower caste. The movie doesnt make a big deal of it while still pointing out caste prejudices. Rajkummar Rao's character in Newton is implied to be Dalit. Sushir Mishra is making a series on Manu Joseph's ""**Serious Men**"" in which Nawazuddin will play a dalit character.

Vicky Kaushal in **Masaan** 

These are some old movies:

 **Ankur (1974):** The Shyam Benegal directed film sees Shabana Azmi play a lower caste woman whom an upper caste landlord falls for. The film won National Awards for Azmi, lead actor Sadhu Meher and for second best feature film.

**Sujata (1959):** The Bimal Roy film is a romance between an upper caste man and an untouchable woman. The Sunil Dutt and Nutan-starrer was awarded the All India Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film at the National Awards that year.

 **Satgati (1981):** The Satyajit Ray directed tele-film tells the story of a poor Dalit, played by Om Puri, who turns around the injustices against lower castes in his village. It was based on a short story of the same name by Munshi Premchand. What about Aamir Khan's character in 3 idiots? Not sure if Dalit specifically, but he certainly wasn't upper caste Most Tamil movies featirecnon-Savarns characters and actors in lead roles. I'm not sure I'd be able to identify a character's caste,if it isn't specifically mentioned. Our naming conventions make that task difficult.

Masan

Saif Ali Khan in Arakshan (I think the first time a superstar in Bollywood played a Dalit character, but it shows casteism)

Achut Kanya and Sujata had dalit female protagonists

Malayalam actor Kalabhavan Mani has portrayed lot of characters who has a Dalit background. In one he acts as an auto driver who becomes IAS. 

The lead protagonists of Malayalam movie Kammattippadam are from Dalit background. It is also about gangwar and not explicit about casteism. That is a brilliant question. All the movies where the hero is lower caste that are stated in this thread (Aarakshan, Shyam Benegal films etc.) are explicitly about caste or the character's (Kachra in Lagaan) caste is a part of the story. But, why do characters in your typical romantic comedies and masala entertainers only called Kapoor or Malhotra or Oberoi or Sharma?

One character I can remember from a recent web-series (Kota Factory) is called Meena which is SC. However, the caste is completely irrelevant to the story - which is pretty heartening. commenting so I can check later. Wow. I cant think of a single one. Good thing I convinced myself to move on from the basic tatti Indian media dishes out in the name of art. How do you identify the cast of the character in a movie? I know I could get downvoted for this, but frankly I don't care. I have zero knowledge on how to ""divine caste from someone's last name"" as I was taught to respect all humans equally, so I don't think about the last names of characters in bollywood movies (if I watch them instead of watching Hollywood) Why does it even matter?
I am sure caste is not something casting directors look for."

Yes, i learn a lot daily, really . You just need the right type of teachers who relate thing to real life. JEE is very fun to actually prepare for. The questions are so challenging and tricky. >How you survived?

Take proper rest. Sleep on time and eat well. It'll help tremendously. Your coaching time is when you should be the most attentive, if you're having headaches, you won't be able to focus properly.

>Did you learn anything?

If I was interested in the topic and my head felt in place, the classes were indeed fun and I learnt a lot. Some of the coaching teachers are very good. If it was a difficult or boring topic, my mind usually drifted away, and not paying attention in class only caused problems in future. Reading a little about the topic that's going to be taught beforehand helps.

If you actually understand what's being taught, it'll become MUCH easier to sit through those 7 hours, trust me. If you didn't get anything in the class today, read your notes, read the textbook, watch YouTube videos on the topic. Watch the video over and over till you finally understand what your coaching teacher was trying to say. There are many good YouTube channels for JEE syllabus, they helped me more than any notes or textbook. 

If you go to the next class without knowing what was taught in this class, it'll only get worse from there.

And bro, I've been in your place. It's very difficult, but you can't do anything about it expect make sure the hardwork you do gives you the result you want. Please make a proper schedule and stick to it. Always analyze how you do the in the exams, and take them seriously. Most importantly, please don't procrastinate. All the best! Education is important but it is so so overrated in our country. 

Plus most Indian students have no practical knowledge at all of what they learn.

I would like to tell you that don't force yourself if you don't like something just because everyone else is doing it.. Like if you don't like coaching classes and spending time there is like a punishment then you should probably self study (there is enough material available these days). If you have enough interest in what you are learning then self studying is really fun and plus you get to know if you are actually interested! Stop using reddit if you want to crack jee ."

I just scheduled my first counselling session after 5 years of running away from depression, anxiety and SAD. I feel a bit anxious about it and don't have any knowledge about how these things go?

What am I expected to share? What to expect from the professional? What information to withhold? Is it really like what is shown in Western cinema and telly?

&#x200B;

Any help is really appreciated.",throwayaForRandia," Tell them what you feel., try and understand the trigger points.. As someone battling SAD and depression id recommend you go to a psychiatrist instead. Psychologists can't prescribe meds and I feel meds (not anti depressants or sedatives) can improve the condition a great deal.  And in my opinion meds should be the first linen of treatment.

Having said that, psychologists can offer CBT which can also help SAD and other mental afflictions. I would suggest seeking both treatments but if that's overwhelming then please consider going to a psychiatrist first Just be completely honest with them.
Don't worry about any judgement or such things  Be honest and speak what you feel your perspective etc. If they want to give you tablets ask them if you can be treated without it .
All the best 🙂 Type your life story so far on a page and hand it over to the psych\*ist. They can read it and gain an initial understanding better this way.

Scheduled,Non-hiring someone because of his/her family name is considered as cast discrimination ?,64,d9f0sj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d9f0sj/nonhiring_someone_because_of_hisher_family_name/,56,"Hi guys !

I was working for a French start-up in Bengaluru recently. One of my responsibility was to be a part of the recruitment team. 

Once, my boss refuses to hire someone because of his  family name/cast.

To tell you everything, he refuses to hire a ""Gowda"" because he wont fit in our team of low-cast villager people profile. 

(lets not discuss about hiring low-profile people from countryside because they are less complaining and more ""flexible"" to be polite)

Is that considered as cast discrimination by the law ?

What is your opinion about that ?  


I DONT MEAN TO OFFEND ANYONE OR ENCOURAGE ANY DISCRIMINATION.

In France, if this was written in a mail it could be enough to engage a court procedure definitely.",MM12300," Gowda is not a family name, it's a caste surname. This is definitely discrimination based on caste irrespective of the hierarchy or class. Are you French btw ? Yes, this is discrimination Yes, it is a caste based discrimination and is criminal. You could report him but I don't think much would happen. I'm confused as to what happened.

Are you saying that your boss wanted to hire low-caste people from a rural background, and rejected a ""Gowda"" because he didn't meet the profile? Your boss is an uneducated and uncultured asshole. Yes this is discrimination. Your boss probably didn't tell him that to his face because he knows it as well. Yes, it is discrimination, and you can call it out. Textbook definition of discrimination. Yes this is discrimination. What you do about it, is upto you. Thanks for all your comments.

I just wanna give you one last tip : never trust MNC or foreign companies from US and Europe.

This people have meeting to discuss cast issues/gender issues and how to manipulate employees to make them work as much as possible.

They will discuss how not to mix cast in offices to ensure peace, they will discuss how to hire farmers kids to make them feel proud to work for foreign companies even if you pay them less than people from cities. They will use all ""modern"" strategies or management such as promising you possibilities of going abroad when they know its impossible for you to go.

Trust yourself, work for Indians companies, settle your business but never run the rat race and give yourself to a MNC company.

Freedom to the people ! :) > To tell you everything, he refuses to hire a ""Gowda"" because he wont fit in our team of low-cast villager people profile. 
>
> (lets not discuss about hiring low-profile people from countryside because they are less complaining and more ""flexible"" to be polite)

I'm curious. Is this the official reason or is it diversity? If it's diversity or low caste empowerment, it's not discrimination. If not, it is discrimination. Publicis Sapient? Yes this caste discrimination by law.

Gowdas are not low cast or from village. Most of them are Bangaloreans. This asshole works in a company in Bangalore but discriminates against native Bangaloreans wtf. Most of the Gowdas i know were nothing but helpful and hard working Your boss probably feels the job is best suited if someone from lower caste gets the job as higher caste people are “usually” richer and has a higher probability of changing the job. For example; a lower caste person will take up sewage cleaning job. A higher caste person will never do that. I may sound politically insensitive but that’s the truth. He would probably argue saying “he knows best” being a local.

Yes, that’s discrimination on your boss part. 

Which job profile is it?! If it was reversed I'd say yes. So no At large, law deems some sort of caste-based ""harassment"" as discrimination. This won't be deemed as caste discrimination legally.

An example, https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/calling-an-sc-chamar-offensive-punishable-says-apex-court/articleshow/3382559.cms

What has happened in your company is something which happens daily with SC/ST candidates in other companies. It is caste discrimination, but not legally.

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)",whiteobsidian," You’re actually saving yourself from getting into a family of hypocrites. Not really a fuck up.

Good luck! I thought caste no longer existed in cities /s

Funny how the OBC girl was open-minded... for the castes above her.  OP, just invite me to your wedding, that's all I care about.

PS: I'm from okayish caste, not too high, not too low. Any caste generally means that they are okay with people of higher caste contacting them.  So ""open minded"" is my caste plus caste considered above mine. Matrimonial sites are hilarious and sad. 

just a thought, you are still 27 why hurry?  There was a gilded comment by a black guy a few days ago that said that he really appreciated when the bullets dogdged him for a change.  This is the same.  Unfortunately Indian matrimonial sites is just online aunty network without the aunties. There will be the same BS except it's online. 

Take some time out and start dating. In the grand scheme of things, finding the right person is as important as JEE. * **Any caste** means **any equal or higher caste**

Educated ""modern"" broad-minded Indian _hypocrites_.

OP, you dodged a bullet with every one of those.

Marry a girl who, as they say, ""loves you at your worst"". You are lucky you got matches. My friend (bengali upper caste) from IIM didn't get any matches when he didn't mention caste in his matrimonial profile 5 years ago. This is what modern day un-touchability looks like >  IIM passout

>earning about 30LPA

*stops reading* IIM does not teach you that Indians are hypocrites of the first order? SC guy here, top educational institution and worked for top companies but not an IIT/IIM guy.

When I got married, the first line of my profile was I am an SC, dont believe in Reservation that benefits only the creamy layer. Rest of the stuff, I was very transparent about what I was looking for - a no-nonsense girl who is non-hypocrite, non pretentious humanist. Caste/religion no bar.

Got fair number of interests from inside and outside my caste. It was hard to see people with matching academic background from an SC caste. The non-SC interests I received were mostly from other religions.

Married to a no-nonsense unpretentious smart girl, her parents are from a brahman + other religion mix. A couple of my close friends who married within their caste have said they wished their married life was as stable as mine, after interacting with my wife and me for a while.

Hang on dude. Fuck this shit. I'm so tired of people acting all ""modern"" on the outside and being a casteist, hater on the inside. This is just ridiculous. 

Dude hugs man. I mean what can I say, just know that if someone asks you your caste they're not worth your time.  [removed] [deleted] [deleted] Lesson no 1. Those who developed a thinking that girls are some magical creatures and are very innocent and caring should know that they are human and just like men are in general shitty. Also given the chance they can act even worse than men and they do.

Lesson no 2. जात कुछ जाती नही

Caste never goes away.

Women at the time of arranged marriage will prefer someone from their caste only no matter how ""open minded,Liberal or progressive they claim to be""

The reason for this? All those lables are to fit in socially and nothing else.

Lesson no 3. Everyone's hypocritical. Some will admit maximum won't. That doesn't change the fact.  Shaadi ka laddu  ouch. some people just suck, OP.  This is just sad.

As much as I hate to say this, you should mention your caste on matrimony sites cos ppl do judge you based on caste and this unfortunately is the reality of India. Better to keep the hypocrites at bay. 

My parents had an inter-caste marriage. That being said, it is a fact there are differences in upbringing (type of food, type of interests etc.) and general attitude/mentality of people ( pet peeves, biases, dinner convos etc.) of families belonging to different castes. This isnt that big a deal if the couple plans to stay away from parents and love each other enough to get over the differences in mentality. But these differences cause a lot of issues when the couple decides to stay with either set of parents. Especially for the wife. I know my mom suffered a bit in her early days since she is from a lower caste compared to my dad, similar thing happened with one of my aunts. My dad stood by my mom and both of them were working and earning so things worked out eventually, my aunt ended up divorcing my uncle.

An upper caste friend of mine married an SC guy and her parents all but abandoned her, her husband's parents were somewhat accepting but issues did creep in over the years and now the couple are staying in a different city.

My advice would be to find a girl who is willing to relocate and not overly attached to parents/family or someone who has stayed abroad or has had a parent who has worked/stayed abroad. In those scenarios the caste issue will likely get diluted Whoa, from Tinder directly to a matrimony website? [deleted] You are being honest in India, mate. Won't work unless she is 1 in a million, who literally doesn't care. 

Ride solo instead. 🤘 i don't know if its true for most grills , but All of the grills i know never married below their so called ""caste strata"", but i know many guys who have relationships/marriages without a fuss about this. All the best OP, you will find a wonderful bride. Till then collect stories to publish a nice entertaining book. it shouldnt be TIFU but the others who f****** up by rejecting you based solely on caste. Good for you... I suggest leave this AM madness and look for someone who actually likes you!  So even a guy earning 30 lpa with IIT-IIM tag can't get over his caste when it comes to marriage 

Why are you not marrying within your community though ??  Damn! That is really sad to read. This must be really hurting for you.
I am SC too and nowhere near OP's financial and education status. I guess, I should start worry about marriage now. 

 I don't get the fuss around castes. I don't know the caste of my ex, I don't know the castes of my best friends, and I couldn't even be bothered to ask. It's an irrelevant label given to people that people don't even get to choose! Telugu people are casteist AF, no ? even here on randia caste feelings about marraige are pretty strong, people got triggered when sometime back i had suggested (after ambedkar) that people should marry outside their caste for eradicating caste system. but seems that caste runs too deeply in the indian psyche Wow i never knew caste is such a huge issue even in urban  areas. I know for a fact that I'm OBC (because 10th board forms. Never knew what my caste is), but I never knew what my exact caste is, since we never used the reservation. 
This discrimination is just saddening. Thank God I'm gay! >Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE.

Go to Europe. Get cool job. Get white girl. They don't know what SC is. why not post this on /r/tifu thread? i mean a lot of foreigners comming here to experience religion should know what they are buying into. What you're facing is ""did not read the instructions carefully"". Indian people don't read instructions on a hazardous item also. Let alone a marriage profile.

And like others have said -- (though you are wasting time), you are saving yourself from hypocrites. This is sick. I hope you find someone good yourself than through this arranged marriage business. Good luck. Such is reality. But keep an open mind and don't give up and weeding out the assholes is easier at this phase than at a later stage -from a person in a similar situation as you Wow ! Great(?) experience, keep track of your experiences till you meet your wife and write a book. One day it can become a movie ! :) This is the saddest thing I have read today. What the fuck people.  Caste is well alive even in urban India. No matter what you get or achieve in your life, you will be always judged by your caste and color. Nothing can change this mentality. I think it happens for your good, can you imagine marry such narrow-minded girl? You saved yourself bro. keep trying on tinder! Lol see the down votes. 
Good Luck OP but I think 27 is too early to get married. Haha this is so funny and so fucked up. ""Incredible india"" This is so sad and disturbing if narrated events are True. I can understand if less educated villagers are caste conscious but highly educated professionals from Metro have such mindset? Shocked and appalled. Perhaps, I was mistaken that people get enlightened with education. [deleted] caste system can't be broken by sustaining the system. you have anyway rejected the reservations that you were provided, for which i respect you. so, i don't see why you should still be hanging onto a demeaning label that somebody else gave your ancestors. just make up a caste of your own and don't call yourself an SC. as far as i know, there is no law preventing you from creating a caste of your own. My best friend a SC is dating a Brahmin. I remember her mother found out and she told her he will never marry you, no higher casts would accept a SC daughter-in-law. Her mother was right. My friend is the daughter to two civil servants. Still this is the status quo.  So no one is talking about 30LPA. OP sorry for your condition, but being a dick that I m, would like sharing your CAT prep strategy.

Obligatory caste notification, Dont know the caste but I m a fucking Tribal  from Bihar and do look like one.

EDIT : Also do invite me to your wedding if you dont mind a tribal in your wedding If you don't mind me asking kaun jaat ho? I mean which caste?

Why I am asking is because most northies including Maharatrians won't know the Telugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them. 

So you can either say bluntly that you are SC or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as SC but it isn't comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements. I mean soften the blow.

Now I am going to  be criticised for what I said above as it's playing the caste game and not taking the high road. However caste is a reality. Also you have chosen arranged marriage route so you can't escape it. Also your own post starts with claming you aren't stereotyptocal SC and you want to play up that card.  Soceital attitudes that makes one cringe. Racism (Skin-color), casteism, or communalism (religion) - these attitudes are programmed into us by an earlier generation , consciously or unconsciously. Its our choice if we want to *work at* eliminating them from our psyche - these are like layers of an onion - impossible to cast off in one go.  

Being in contact with diverse people can of course speed up the unlearning. You're fucking better off bro. You're killing it professionally (and you can only go up from here) and you're obviously intelligent and well educated. I'm not saying this to lift your spirits or whatever, you don't need that shit. What I'm saying is, if these people want to cling to archaic bullshit, let them. They may think you're beneath them but they're wrong. You outclass them by far. You do you bruh. I will die alone someday because I am of lower caste too minus the IIM pass out and fat paycheck stuff.

I once passed out in front of a college so I guess that counts :D Dude, what do you expect in India? It's uniformly hypocritical. Live and learn, I guess. **becuase there is a caste system , there's so much of reservation** 
Now , why do you want to curb down the 49% that the general category has ? 
I'm against the part where they allow them to take a general seat . 
I know reservation can't be eliminated fully , atleast not in the near future  Matrimonial sites are cancer. Avoid them at all costs. It's better to get fixed by relatives. Maybe I don't really understand the issues of the SC/ST but why would you actively identify with something that has kept you and your people down for so long? You could have just said you were buddhist and have lived without a caste for the last 3 generations.

You could have been happily married by now OP but instead you would rather everyone know that you're part of a victimized subjugated interest group. > I figured I was ready to get married.

How ya figure that? long time no sex? I wanna know coz me 26.  You have worked hard for everything in life, work a little bit more for that SO, who accepts everything from you.  Teli? Isn't that Jewish? You got jebaited.... :/ Bullet dodged like Neo from the Matrix, OP! Congrats and good luck in your spouse-hunt! As far as my experience goes - Even girls who are 'liberal' (  fuck around) mostly end up with with guys from their own caste only  Arranged marriage is a fucked up process, OP. If it is any consolation, I'm from an upper caste and I explicitly mentioned that I don't give a fuck about caste on my matrimonial profile only to face rejection from both upper and lower castes. 
I was dumped by my gf of 2 years the moment her parents found out I'm a different caste and went on to emotionally blackmail her. Mind you, her caste is lower than mine. She even had this super liberal JNU feminist personality facade about her. Imagine my heartbreak when she jumped on the first opportunity to get hitched to an UPSC job guy her parents introduced to her. Her parents' main objection? My caste. IIM is one caste i like. haha. Can i send my matrimonial page link for you to check? Let meknow [deleted] You said you never used reservation. Here's a take on why people don't : when you're eligible in the general category too , you use  the 'general' seat so that a seat in reservation remains empty , so someone else who got a lower rank can get that benefit. That's how general seats get eaten up. That's not something to be proud of , actually !  > lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE

For non reserved candidates, that just makes it worse... putting salt on a wound. >AIR in 600's general


So you chose not to pick a better course at a better IIT using your quota? If you didn't, you're stupid. If you did, you did actually make use of the reservations benefits


There's no need to be this smug and patronizing. Marriages are social contracts, it involves adapting yourself to your spouse's family/culture in varying degrees. If someone's not fond of a certain group of people, ofcourse theyre not going to marry into that caste. 

Also, different castes have different track records with status of women. So if an upper caste woman refuses to marry a guy from a largely illiterate lower caste, it is very much understandable since chances are very high her freedom is going to be severely curtailed. Did you find any girls who were fine with your caste but felt family wont approve? Did you suggest any to try to discuss about your caste with their family?  Which IIM ? When did you pass out? Where do you work now? 
Edit: why the hate? Just want to make friends Why the fuck would someone WANT to marry below his or her social strata if given the choice?"

Or  only when experience is same then the reservation is used ? Where and how to start the backlash/protest? Twitter?      
I am pretty sure no prominent figure is gonna raise their voice against this.    
We are on our own.    
 Agle janam mohe minority hi kijo.   
 The worst thing about this reservation is that the government thinks job is just a one-way monthly income to the worker. The government never thinks of the quality of the work / importance of having merit do the job. This has the potential to irrepairably damage the standard of education / health and government services. Probably when an MP would have to get operated on by a non-meritous SC / ST surgeon they would know.

They should keep STEM merit based and away from reservation. How much empowerment does one need before feeling empowered? Apparently, not even after having a job.

I fail to see the rationale behind this. When in opposition, these sanghis would have called such a move ""appeasement"". I guess party with a difference is only different in terms of having a forked tongue.

I'm not even getting into merits of reservations in promotions- if designed properly, those would help counter the inherent bias within the system. However, knowing how spectacularly""the most capable administrator in india"" botched gst implementation, by passing a law without thinking (one country, one tax, only in name), and implementing it without being prepared, i can bet that there hasn't been any thought beyond, ""how can we split the dalit vote?"" Yeah fuck that.  Fine as long as its clerical work.  But I don't want my chief of surgery to be an average student. Where merit matters,  relaxation of criteria shouldn't be there. It's not going to be a big problem if you promote a 95% percent scoring SC/ST guy over a 97% general,  but not very good for general public when a general guy with all India rank 20,000 doesn't get admission to a govt medical college but a scst student who didn't even qualify for the admission has been admitted because there weren't any candidates from that caste who scored more than 50th percentile.

**SC, ST quota in promotion: Narendra Modi government takes this big decision** 

 ______ 
The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.
(PTI)

The Centre today asked all its departments and the state governments to
implement reservation in promotion for employees belonging to Scheduled Caste
(SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The move comes following a recent
verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard. The Personnel Ministry, in an
order, said, “The cadre controlling authorities of Central government
ministries, departments and Union territories are to carry out promotions in
accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” Every promotion order
must clearly mention the stipulation that the promotion shall be subject to
further orders which may be passed by the Supreme Court, it said. According to
the order, besides the Central government departments concerned, state
governments are also advised to take necessary action in this matter.

The personnel ministry order will be applicable to SC and ST category
employees working with the Centre and the state governments, an officer said.
The apex court had on June 5 allowed the Centre to go ahead with reservation
in promotion for employees belonging to the SC and ST category in “accordance
with law”.

The top court took into account the Centre’s submissions that entire process
of promotion has come to a “standstill” due to the orders passed by various
high courts and the apex court had also ordered for “status quo” in a similar
matter in 2015. “We will say you (Centre) can go ahead with promotion in
accordance with law,” a vacation bench comprising Justices Adarsh Kumar Goel
and Ashok Bhushan had told Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Singh,
representing the Centre.

During the hearing, the ASG cited the case laws on the issue of quota in
promotion in government jobs and stated that the apex court’s 2006 judgement
in M Nagaraj case would be applicable. The M Nagaraj verdict had said that
creamy layer concept cannot be applied to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes for promotions in government jobs like two earlier verdicts of 1992
Indra Sawhney and others versus Union of India (popularly called Mandal
Commission verdict) and 2005 E V Chinnaiah versus State of Andhra Pradesh,
which dealt with creamy layer in Other Backward Classes category.

On November 15 last year, a three-judge bench of the apex court had agreed to
consider whether its 11-year-old judgement in M Nagaraj case was needed to be
re-visited. The nine-judge bench of Supreme Court had, in the Indira Sawhney
case in 1992, permitted reservation for the SCs and STs in promotion to
continue for a period of five years from November 16, 1992.

***The move comes following a recent verdict by the Supreme Court in this regard.*** 

But Modi ""did it"" ... /s

 ""Why are Indians settling in abroad?"" Sab Ka Sath. Sub ka Vikas The rationale behind this move seems to be to counter the domination of upper castes in certain posts like that of secretary in a ministry. There was a study done in 2013 which showed that out of 150 posts of secretary, there were 0 SC's and about 3 ST's. Its unimaginable that out of 150 posts the govt/establishment wasnt able to find even 1 SC IAS officer for a secretary level post. 

Even today you can take a look at the secretaries from the important ministries and you'll find a majority of them are from the upper castes.

Reservation in promotion makes the concept of reservation more meaningful. A lot of deputations are decided upon the discretion of the govt/minister. No marks for guessing which group gets the maximum bulk of those posts.

 This is terrible. This is ass backwards, there needs to be a system in place to remove senior discrimination for promotions instead of having more reservations in promotions."

Plz all the bhaiya's and didi's help me out. I just wanna get some more options.",sir_chad_the_69th," If you are interested in CS you can look for either BCA or BSc computer science programs.  You wont have the physics and chem in them. The BCA and BSc computer programs in CHRIST university, Bangalore are really good if you wanna consider. Also check out for other good universities that offer similar programs. 

Your options if you don't want phy and chem are pretty lit so dont get disheartened. Check out BSc Stat programs at ISI and check BSc eco programs at Shiv Nadar and CU Chennai and Christ Uni .

You can check arts too if you are interested 
Start by checking this link from CBSE for options after 12th.  Enquire  with others or colleges about what you like.

This sub is IT heavy. Don't study for law if its not your thing. I did very well in CLAT(Top 100), but it doesn't always translate to being good at legal profession. Moreover, the amount of people who quit law within two years of getting into a job is astronomical. 10% of people in the last graduating batch quit before their convocation. The batch that graduated 3 years ago, 40%. And that from a college where everyone who wants a law firm job gets it, and they get paid well. But the work is soul crushing, Not to mention that if you have any ethical opinions or are left leaning, you can throw your ideology in the trashcan. Corporate Slavery is the way most people make it.

Think about what really interests you. Its better to take time and join a good course than to regret taking it in your 4th-5th year. Be careful. And don't do it under parental pressure, even though they want the safest option for you. You have to live with your life choices. Bear that in mind. Blaming them later on won't change a thing. Be prudent. Hi. You're carrying too much shame for someone who is so young. The concept of a scholastic career is defunct. The field I'm in changes faster than a normal human can keep up with it (and no, I'm not talking about IT). My undergrad training in the mid 2000s is almost useless to me now a decade later.

How you do on arbitrary exams in school has very little to do with the totality of your career in the future.

Let's stop worrying about ""wageslavery"" and things like that now, at least in your case. It's a tough situation for many to be in and it happens all over the world in all societies. But I don't really think the concept means what you think it means. 

Now, try not to take this as an insult or a comment on your health, but I think you should speak to a well trained psychologist who is trained in cognitive behavioral therapy. They will be able to help you get out of this negative self imaging that you have created for yourself.

I wish I could offer you concrete career advice, but I don't think that's your problem. If you learn how to identify the negative self  imaging in your own thoughts, then things like career choices, etc will become alot easier.

I wish you my best. From my experience, I was lucky to know what I like. You have to try different things in order to know that. Trying different things in India is challenging because there are no student jobs or good intern experiences. Another way around that will be volunteering.  So some advices are,

* I genuinely think that volunteering in different kind of jobs can give self-realization on what you would like to pursue in life. 
* Don't look at age or any boundaries in terms of what you can do or not. Remember all boundaries and likings are generated by your mind/ past experiences, try to think calmly and dwelling too much on the future is seriously dangerous. 
* Use mind as a tool when required otherwise observe and enjoy the current activity you are working rather than thinking whether is this helping me or not. Whatever you do, do it with passion. Aim high, and then push yourself hard to achieve your goal. A degree from a good university matters. Choose a course that offers options for employment or at least gives you satisfaction and pride. Best of luck, brother! No offence to you mate, I never understand why people think of CA as an option if you fail to get into an engineering college. 

It takes minimum time of 4.5- 5 years to finish CA course, unlike regular colleges there is absolutely no guarantee you would ever finish the course and become a CA in your lifetime. Final exam takes continuous preparation of >6 months with minimum 8-10 hours a day. It's definitely not an option incase you don't get an engineering seat. I have passed CA Final G1 awating G2 results, so I know what it takes. It takes sheer dedication, willingness and hard work to pass CA. Even then nothing is certain, if you don't pass CA final you are forever stuck with Inter and not so bright career growth prospects. If you don't pass Inter every single second you spent in this course would absolutely be a waste.

Unlike CS field which recognises talents and appreciates it ( You may not even have a degree but if you are great with coding Tech companies and start-ups will hire you)  you are nothing without the CA qualification behind your name, you may have the talent, knowledge but until you pass the exam you can never be an Auditor. 

Make your decisions wisely, if you are really passionate about becoming a CA I would suggest you to pursue it after your bachelors. You wouldn't have to write the Foundation exam and incase things go south you would have a safe exit option too. Why are Law and CA your only options? 

Idk about Law but you should look at the syllabus for CA. It's not IIT JEE but it's also not likely to be easy for someone with 65% in 12th. Plus, a lot of people who enrol do find it boring. 

There are tonnes of interesting courses that you might actually enjoy. Go to a random university's website and browse through all the courses they offer. 

If your parents aren't convinced of their earning potential,tell them you'll enter academia or something. That should do it. India needs industries and entrepreneurs. Just by what India needs I would suggest you develop the required skills and go in this direction.

\-my opinion I work in IT sales. Its a combination of IT field and sales job. I don't earn much currently as I am new to the industry . Now get 20k monthly. I am OK for now in terms of happiness. I wish I earned more, but I know I will reach there. I think Law is a good field. \[SERIOUS\] Answers only, It's my personal opinion and it might be biased but I find IIT path the best.
I am in my final year of IIT. I pretty much wasted my 4 years in gaming, movies and shits and still managed to get a >12 LPA job. Almost everyone around me did the same. You would have a lot of options at your disposal, foreign jobs, studies, research, top corporate job and what not. Facilities at IITs are no match for other college. My friends who went into CA, medical and Law have to work hard as their their studies are hell lot of tough than ours and they get paid peanuts in the start of their career. So if you can take a drop and do whatever it takes to clear JEE, go for it. Trust me it pays back. [deleted]"

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

Hope this story helps someone out there",masoomdon," Such shit keeps coming back with different names. There was ebiz, they were booked for fraud. Now it's QNET. We need to keep people aware of this. Thanks for sharing. I had an old colleague who was trying to convince me to join some mlm group.

He actually showed me pics from Malaysia and some other country. So these guys sponsor foreign trips ? r/antimlm would love this. Beware. The same guys are now roaming on the LinkedIn and sending unsolicited Connect request with a followup message on the upcoming excellent business proposition. > cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro.

Lel If you're getting scammed by Qnet in 2019,  you deserve to be scammed.

Unfortunately there are tons of other companies that are better at concealing the pyramid scheme and I've seen many people who are victims and don't even know it. I recently came across an upcoming company called DearLife with the same modus operandi. >first I meet this lady

Was the lady good-looking? I experienced pretty much the same story; but a downgraded version in 2013. The meeting happened in a CCD outlet in Bandra. I wasn't even offered a coffee. Got caught into this by my ex-boss. 

The best reason that the female recruiter gave me was that she woke up at 5.30AM that day because she WANTED to see the sun rise. I was the schmuck, according to her, who got up early because he had to reach office on time. If only I would join her ponzi scheme, even I could enjoy such financial independence, she implied.  

Told her that I needed to be in office early the next day and left quickly. > cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro

but you got free snacks! My best friend joined some mlm back in 2004. It was just 3000 payment and same old 2 members story. I told him take my 3000 and make me member if you really need to make member because you are my best friend but i will not make any new members. Being a best friend he denied my offer. Soon he realized its not worth. I just plainly say I don't have money or time😂 A friend of mine approached me with the same scheme. I too had to go through what you had too, just said their company is ocean, which indeed is a part of qnet. About 4-5 years ago in Bangalore, a randommer approached my flatmate and I...while we were shopping for groceries. Noped out of there and my flatmate was already aware of the scam. I went there to have an amazing buffet lunch. Enjoyed it. 😁 QNet is old scam. Qnet, EBiz are some local MLM scams. Herbalife is international which is also found in India. * I met a QNET guy a whole ago at CCD, asked him to pay for the coffee and the pizza and acted interested while eating it and after finishing it, asked him to get lost What do they do with the pan card ? Do they misuse it ? Qnet I believe is the same company which was running Goldquest, Questnet etc. back in 2000s.

These companies made me wary and skeptical of any of the old school or college mates or old colleagues who suddenly contact me out of the blue. Thankfully many just wanted to connect again. Dude, I pretty much experienced the same stuff from QNet, except for the claims that were made to you about income. So atleast they were a bit honest than the ones you met..
Also after couple of hours, I was eventually told what was the business.. 2 whole hours of sitting there and listening to the BS they kept on saying. The whole CCD was populated by this guys/gals only.. Btw I am talking about Bengaluru.

One of my camaraderie, did infact purchase the product of around 3 lacs. Dude still posts photos of his travels to mostly Thailand... Inspirational quotes. But believe me, that guy has multiple credit cards and maxed out most of them. Has taken several loans. He might be successful in the long run (1/100), but totally not worth for the effort that he puts in... a friend got into amway and tried hard to get me in. i even joined the program but only used for personal purchases so my account did not last for long. made a few thousand rupees. but of course spent more on buying products (for personal use). products were good but not worth the premium prices but it was ok. good fun experiment. 

eventually the friend became so pushy that i had to end up cutting him out of my personal life. not sure how well he is doing with his amway venture. he had a well paying job and i hope he is still continuing there. 

on related note... `on becoming a god in central florida` is a good show worth watching on mlm programs. it's not a documentary. probably satire. good watch. 

also... have seen notices at chaayos, ccds and other outlets mentioning how mlm sales pitches are not allowed on their premises. things must be crazy for them i guess. QNet is everywhere. My old college friend(now he's not) used to call me years after college just to say how are you and casually mention how amazing his business is doing. Guess what? His business is making other people give money to QNet. Fuck those people

I regret not outing this guy on the college whatsapp group What snacks did you get?"
Scheduled,Either India's property developers are insane or I am.,193,d4jscs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4jscs/either_indias_property_developers_are_insane_or_i/,154,"I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality


Can't wait to hear how millennials killed the realty sector",mrfreeze2000," Try Faridabad, Noida or Ghaziabad. Delhi, due it development commands a hell lot of price in the property market. Gurgaon was once for those who couldn't afford a home in South Delhi. Thanks to corporate invasion, Gurgaon too has become expensive even after having terrible infra. Meanwhile, in Noida Extension, you'll find guys jumping in the middle of the road trying to sell a 3bhk for 30 lacs ( that too is negotiable). At the end of the day, all boils down to demand supply and development. Truth is, nobody is buying. Larger Builders are forced to launch to cover costs of old projects, continuously be able to make debt payments, while raising more debt, monetize existing land inventory and most importantly to keep up appearances. My suggestion is to look for builders who have less than 10 projects and are heavily focused on per project profitability and not company wide profitability or best buy plot and build. DM if you have questions. It doesn't make any sense, you are being charged premium for an apartment which is not yet built and will also depreciate with time, not to forget it's at a location which MAYBE developed in the next few years.
There is definitely a real estate bubble, we just don't know how it will pop. I've worked in this sector and have followed the demand and supply trend and I would urge you to reconsider your decision to buy an apartment.

Reason 1: a land surplus area such as NCR will always have new apartments coming up and your old apartments will never see a decent ROI. 

Reason 2: Delhi has over 5 years worth of supply to clear out before demand picks up again. No one is buying these expensive concrete slabs in sky. Why should you? 

If you just want to park your money for long term then buy semi liquid govt bonds. If you're worried about inflation eating away your investments then buy gold.

If you're still hell bent on investing in real estate then buy land. Apparently we've stopped making land. (͡•_ ͡• ) >Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

NRIs of Randia are buying them for investment. Its all speculation. They are building flat with the target in mind that 20LPA guy invest all of his live in their flat. But ignore the other fact of life. Its utterly foolish to invest in a flat which will degrade over time at that high cost.

You are right soon they will cry millennial but no one ask them about unreasonable price. Its is same like doing Challan of 25K for15k bike. Go to hell. Read somewhere that people are buying second-hand homes directly from owners instead of from builders because of this. I always have wondered how realty companies are always keeping the price high even when economy is not really well or supply is very high. There is no real supply-demand pricing in the industry at all. I wouldn’t doubt for a minute that there is collusion between the developers and they keep the price high.

Also, the money is paid upfront for many developments and they are not the ones losing money if it’s delayed due to not all apartments getting sold. Real estate is the black hole in which all the wealth, clean and ill gotten alike, flow. 

Nothing ever makes sense in real estate.

New money is created after existing assets and this leads to asset price inflation.

The only way to control this is to have a property price linked progressive rates/fees pegged at 0.5-2% to fund local governments. For second property, increase it to double unless rented out on long term lets. This would make it unattractive to invest unless you want to live there.

This would remove housing from the list of investment/speculative instruments and finance local authorities to find basic things like trash collection and footpaths. Property rates will fall as well and hurt a lot of people. You must also understand the dynamics of constructing a building. Firstly, the primary determinant of price is the value of the land. Then you need govt permits and passing. You need to get sewage lines and roads. For all of this, you must grease the wheels. Also, often times, the landowners charge extremely high prices for the land itself as it’s a psychological factor among Indians regarding real estate. It causes the prices to sky rocket while old farmland owners now ride around in Mercs and bmws. In order to distribute cost, builders are left with one of two choices, either build more apartments and smaller sizes, but govt doesn’t give permission over a certain height, or they can build big apartments and price it at luxury. Not saying builders are victims here, there is sufficient addition of their margins as well. 

I come from a builder family and have been involved in this all my life. These are my 2 cents on the topic. I recently also saw a video that I will share below. It’s not on this topic but it will help get a little more clarity on the subject. 


https://youtu.be/sgEq0HSsAQc ""They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.""

Wait. What do you mean, ""Next Term""? Building Construction Money distribution 

Local netas need it 

Local sp need it 

Local municipal corporation needs it 

Plus add mafia too sand/ cement etc 

Builders are not going to give them money out of their own pocket 

Hence this high price Boss if you think this is insane, try Mumbai, I am totally at a loss to understand how normal folk can afford to buy an apartment in Mumbai.
I gave up waiting for the bubble to burst a good five years ago..
I keep hearing rumours about the supposed real estate crash, but it hasn’t happened and don’t think it will.. This is all well and good but why haven't you installed an ad-blocker my friend?

>So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties. I think it's same in all other states, I am from Ajmer, Rajasthan project is not yet started and prices of these flats starts from 2-3 crores... And this just only..🙄 Come to Hyderabad... Why don't you buy a parcel of land and build your own mansion? It's better than living under the whims and fancies of pesky associations who will dictate their oft irrational terms.

Plus you can hire an architect to design the building exactly to your specifications. Most will even be willing to work within your budgetary constraints.

I only mention this because you said you can afford a house. Imo if you are looking for something permanent t3-t4 cities are the choice.

Way healer living cost.


However I know people  live somewhere while they work. Idk how though.

You pay rent for decades you lose a lot of money.

Loan+ emi system is no good again cause you the prices are too high. My dad bought land a couple of years ago that was double registered and had to take a loss. Another one was encroached (but that was like 20 years ago). If I was buying it as an investment or remotely, an apartment is way lower risk. Of course, location is the most important criteria and those apartments sound like an terrible idea on that basis. Probably don't go for brand builders. I'm considering one here in Bangalore that is being sold at 5900/sqft. It's at a great location and the flat has been coming along well. Only thing is it's not a brand everyone knows. 

I did the math and the rent yield on this flat is similar to what my relatives have in Australia (iirc around 20 odd years to pay off your buy price at the current rental value). Indian property developers are idiots tbh, I can conclude that after working with them for sometime. 

Don't buy a house now, at least for next 4-5 years there won't be any reasonable price increase. Primary reason being there's already too much unsold inventory. Buy only distress sale properties. 

To answer your godrej example the reason they're charging premium cause they have the quality and finance to complete the project, which hardly any developer has.

Lot of investors buy at extremely low prices before launch and later sell at market prices whoever is ready to buy or they just hold them to park their money.

Prices won't come down no matter how much people want they just won't increase in the years to come .

Keep renting that's a better way, I took me some time but I've convinced my parents it makes no sense to buy a home vs renting


You can also read the interview of abhishek lodha ceo of lodha group on economic times 


Wait for next year to see problems with lodha like with jaypee


*Refinancing risk mounts at Lodha Dev* 

1. India Ratings downgraded Lodha’s debt to BBB-, citing large FY20/F21e debt maturities, poor operational performance, and weak 
refinancing environment.

2. Of the total gross debt of ~Rs256bn, ~66% is domestic; ~55% of domestic debt is with NBFCs. Total debt maturing in FY20e and FY21e is ~Rs60bn, and ~Rs94bn, respectively.

3.  Refinancing seems inevitable, as internal accruals are unlikely to be sufficient, given the current slow pace of residential sales (which plummeted 17% in FY19).

4. The major assets backing the refinancing of debt are the unencumbered Palava landbank of ~3,300 acres (valued at ~Rs330bn) and unsold inventory of ~Rs329bn

5. Bulk of the sales, going forward, is likely to accrue from six key MMR projects, so the  company may have to reduce prices to address falling sales. As Mumbai's biggest developer, any price action by Lodha is also likely to impact market pricing. Millennials killed the sector by not having 7 crores to buy these places, nor being stupid enough to take out a 7 cr loan which they'll pay off for the rest of their life. 

Stupid stupid millennials. Honestly  many uninformed NRI keep buying these as  ""investments"" but adjusted for inflation and apartment does not appreciate at all . 


 It's better to rent these apartments and buy a small plot of land with your money . Just make sure all documents are in order and don't buy in a boom they lobby together for the prices.

once the rate has been set you can do nothing. no law is useful. if the builder says i am pricing x amount then you have to pay the x amount.  they can bring RERA and all other things. but nothing is going to change. 

reason is the economic divide and population > houses available. also there is lot of political backing.

once a builder for *reconstruction* told me that people who will those 3-4 cr for the house want to leave with standard people. those who have been leaving in the building are not of the standard and hence must leave.

so basically he was reconstructing on their plot/ building and making profit on their land. but wanted them to leave because they were not standard people.

the society is also equally responsible for this shit. This is horryfying to say the least.Soon people might have to living like hostel life for the rest of their life. Agree Gurugram is very expensive Same situation here , my dad is retiring soon and we are looking for a new villa in Ahmedabad. Most of the independent houses starts from 3-4 cr. It's not like we cannot afford it , they are totally 100% not worth the price. Asking 3cr for 2500 square feet house which is outskirts of the city is insane Similar shit in Pune. Everywhere you see hoarding for flats, but I feel these are way overpriced. 

A small 2 BHK cost 70lakh + in Punawala DLF Phase 3 is NOT a good place to move to. It’s overbuilt and among the worst maintained areas of  Gurgaon among other things. I’ve spent 25 years here and  looking forward to moving out next year. Exactly the same shit in Pune. I was lucky enough to get a small bit of land early on and built my own *little mansion*. 

My friends find themselves in this situation now and they are explaining me the same shit. It is ridiculous that a property developer who has just bought land and finished planning the structure has somehow managed to assess property value at the time of sale (X years later, 5 or more), rate of ameneties and this one was an absolute shocker for me; cost for parking space: in lakhs! (WTF!) 

>	At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life.

If you like a particular place you’re renting, it’ll be far easier to negotiate a long rental term with the owner than negotiating a price with these real estate people. 

While doing so, you can create a fund reserve and buy a decent chunk of land to build a proper house. 

>	I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda.

Perhaps if you can defer this for a later date, you can invest in other stuff right now and later use this invested money to invest in real-estate. > Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me

Indian real estate market was a 3 way ponzi scheme till RERA came in.  Prices won't go down because it makes all 3 parties unhappy. Its a mexican standoff, they are all holding guns to each others head. Everybody loses if prices go down. Best case prices go sideways for 10 years and effectively get cheaper after adjusting for inflation.

Builders would sell all their flats at pre launch for a discount, get paid upfront and use that to launch a new project and repeat the exercise. Banks were happy to lend ever increasing amounts to such customers since home loans have low default rates and it builds their loan book. Buyer would make 20% down payment, builder is 'taking care of EMI' till possession anyways. Even if they sell it for 20% appreciation in 3 years. Its 100% profit since they only paid 20% to begin with.

Obviously big assumption is that you will find a buyer in 2-3 years for your property. As long as that keeps happening everyone is happy.

Problem was specially bad in NCR market. If you make a list of flat owners of most of the stuck NCR projects, you'll find quite an overlap, same usual suspects owning flats in multiple projects now struggling to pay their EMIs. When it comes to Purchasing property I have a boomer mindset, will never buy a house in a city, rent it all the way. At worst rather will buy a farmland in my hometown with that sort of money. >5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? 

It is estimated that most of the black money is is real estate . There is your answer. I have already invested in a flat in bangalore just 5 years back thinking that this is what i ""should"" invest in my lifetime for sure. I hastily bought one in a slightly center part of the city which was in my budget but by a sub par builder. I have regretted it few months after moving in for various of reasons. 

I strongly believe there are other great movable investing options than real estate which has faster and easier liquidating process. I would have not bought the flat had I had this knowledge. They keep putting out non affordable products that nobody wants and complain when nobody buys. Kinda like automobile.

Honda city has more than doubled in price over 10 years while remaining pretty much the same car. ""how to make very substantial money"" ? please suggest ಠ_ಠ.. (serious reply only)"
Scheduled,DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference),21,dsirfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsirfe/do_and_dont_of_flight_travel_due_to_increase_in/,18,"Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem. And if they can't, chances are you were the reason ( Like you coming 40 mins before flight and check in is closed.) Don't be the guy who screams - I KNOW YOUR MANAGER/MAALIK/OWNER/DAD etc. 

4. DO NOT worry that you will crash lol. Many people who are travelling for first time may be scared. I don't blame them as flight crashes are always big news.

However rest assured because the chances that you will get into a car accident is HIGHER compared to you getting in flight accident. Seriously. It is THAT safe.

If I remember more stuff, I will mention it here. Others also please combine and add stuff which I may have forgotten. I am a busy man",heteretes," >I am a busy man

Playing doctor-nurse again? Do you work at the airport? Stop posting here. Every post and every comment of yours comes off as arrogant. We don’t need people like that here. Stop fishing for upvotes. You won’t find them here.  For domestic travel, instead of queueing, use self check-in kiosks.  Saves you time. Time in queue can be 30+ minutes in busy airports and hence tiring.

You may not get your preferred seat, but that is okay for me. Yaas dear , hum hii akele berozgaar hain But people survive car accidents.. how many survive plane accidents?

What we need is reservation based economic situation of the person/family. I think is a two step issue.

1. Determine who is economically backward (irrespective of cast/religion)
2. Provide the economically backward reservation instead of any cast.

Step 2 is trivial. Step 1 is the difficult one cause any system that relies on papers/bureaucracy will be derailed by corruption. What we need is a way to track people's income and spending. The country needs to become more or less cash free before this can happen.

 Destroying lower caste is one of the key objective of RSS/BJP.  "

Everything is available at a little distance, the best restaurants, products, events, hospitals, services etc. Running to the big city for every small thing isn't very convenient.

Among metros, I'd suggest Hyderabad, where I live. It's apparently the most liveable city in India, quite diverse, friendly people, less traffic than other metros and affordable. It also has great internet providers (my experience with ACT broadband has been quite good). Villages of Himachal are cheap af plus people are good plus you live close to nature plus snowfall and and cold all the time. Saving for later."

If you don't want to spend 20-30k on the lens, get the EF adapter and use one of the pancake lenses (24 or 40 f2.8) Olympus EM1O mark 2. Excellent camera and cheap now because mark 3 has come out. Couple that with cheap prime lenses, 17mm, 25mm or 45mm. Fujifilm Xt20 with 27mm f2.8
Really good combo for a great price. Are proper DSLRs obsolete already? Sony a6100 or if you can stretch a bit more the a6400. Real time tracking is a game changer."

I want to find out a few things and I guess India could help me:
1. What are prospects of business?
2. How good is this as a career for not just survivability but to thrive? (I don't want to live in a mansion but yeah in long term a life where I don't have to worry)
3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?",musterkin," I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.
I wish you all the best :) [deleted]"

Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,8,dc6k28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,19,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.",desikid25," They will probably start unfollowing you or whatever it's called. You would probably not be having a straightforward conversation at that with those who find it offensive. I don't think so , Indian hot celebrities already have pics like these.

Make your art , have something unique in it.

People will appreciate. Create a new instagram handle, simple. Also talk to @framesbyankit Ashleel launda h - 3 idiots Stick to what you enjoy doing. People who will relate to your content will stick and support you.  
And trying new thing brings new opportunity to learn and experiment more. All the best.  
\-  
I left taking portraits when I found my interest in Travel photography. Instagram (@xtermist) I my self am an amateur photographer and I post on Instagram. What my personal thinking is that, only people who are very close to you, like family might feel a bit weird per se. 

But other than that, your friends or people who really appreciate photography should be fine with  it. 

Personally, I don't think I can post any such pictures, I can't even post portraits of my friends smoking because my parents and close family follow me on Instagram. 

In conclusion, I think only your family and maybe teachers (i honestly don't know about them) will react oddly. But if you don't have a problem and want to showcase your are, please do so. It'll be a good experience and if you get negative feedback, you can always stop if you want. 

Hope this helped. 

P.S. Please share your Instagram photography page.

And check my page out 😁 @vmodani.photography Well post you thinking of bringing a bit of change to your style of photography...but whatever you do everyone is going to flip or act weird. 

But your are a photographer and it comes with your job to explore and you should do it. Mind telling us the insta account might follow u if it's good Post on Reddit first"

Photography,Advice for starting a Videography/Photography business in India.,14,d8p4jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d8p4jm/advice_for_starting_a_videographyphotography/,4," I've been learning about Videography and Photography for a while now. I've also done a few ads for local businesses (at really cheap rates) for online advertising. I was trying to get a job but the salaries for videographers in India are so bad! I believe I have enough knowledge about Video production to start a business. But I do not know anything about starting a business.

Can you guys explain to me or give me a link to somewhere I can read about the legal procedures of starting a business in India? I'm planning on starting really small by myself as I do not have enough experience to warrant high prices. I'll be charging 10k for a basic Ad. I'll be working from my home and doing the shooting and editing by myself. So considering the scope of my business what all do I have to keep in mind? Also, can I do this without registering it as a business in the beginning? I assume that's illegal.

Another issue is that I live in a really boring little town in Kerala. I would love to move to a bigger city. But as you can imagine that requires more money, Money I can spend on better equipment. I don't have a laptop. I edit using my PC which is not portable. If I am to move to a city I'd probably have to take out a loan. I guess I'll have to travel to those cities for work anyway because most businesses in my area don't require such services. I'd love to hear your opinion on this too.

Any advice will be much appreciated! Thanks in advance.",MlHMH," No service business has to be registered with GST unless the annual turnover is over 20lacs.

For manufacturing it's 40 lacs. 

Just get a current account in companies name if you REALLY want to be all official-sy. You may require a labour or shop registration that can be done online in under three minutes and print out taken. 

Otherwise, open a normal current account in YOUR NAME and pay income taxes as a professional. 

I'm in a related business myself, and would advise you to get into wedding photography too."

I slogged through most of my college days, somehow managing an meagre five pointer.

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",okchinmayarawat," Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography. [Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion. Check out videos of [JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/videos) \- he does photography and good YouTube videos as a hobby while serving on a merchant vessel.

You can join photography college/school. There are many. Also look into online classes

If you've a DSLR, try practicing on your own. Shoot in manual. 

Also parallely, learn photoshop/GIMP/Lightroom. People find it tough. But post-processing is necessary specially when shooting Raw."

Is there a story where a dude/dudette worked hard, got a camera on his/her own savings and the started pursuing it as a hobby? I would love to hear what you guys think. I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now.",thisisatypo," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai."

Photography,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2222,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,465,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.

Just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. 
Now I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. 
More power to you, to me and everyone who needs. 

You'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     

I am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   

I did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    

None the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   
 
Anyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   

The moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   
 JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     

Don't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  


If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   

And again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   
I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It’s never too late to do anything. Good luck 👍 That's some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of 24. Late bloomer but I'll surely gonna have a great career ahead Wise man learns from others' mistakes. So here's a mistake I made that you could learn from. In my graduation, all I did was try and pass exams. I did well in grades, but in terms of learning or knowledge, I didn't have much. So I had to go back to basics after my degree. Don't do this. Please take keen interest in your classes, curriculum, and additional learning. Don't be just a literate, be an educated person. All the best :) More power to you, bro! Sotti khub bhalo lagche eita porey!
I hope you become really big in life. Thank you for inspiring us to work a little harder. It's awesome you chose this for yourself! Never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities  from you unexpectedly. You had the chance to grow and you took it. That's a win in my book.
My father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was 16 because my grandfather wanted that for him. He had wanted to do b.tech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly. My father was financially burdened at 18 yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his 4 unmarried sisters.
He could never pursue b.tech again and its his biggest regret in life. 
Don't listen to society and do your own thing. All the best! >Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments

Most of my photographer friends are facing this issue too. They have tried to get endorsed by brands. But only a few succeeded. Tough career path.

Anyways happy for you. This post motivated me to get up and fucking study while I've time. I'm a bit depressed regarding the backlogs in my masters. Hope to get over it soon. Great for you bro. 

I don't think you'll need it but if you want any advice on frontend web-dev, just PM me, been doing it for two years.. Thanks man, your post was really encouraging, as someone who failed in previous master program and trying to go back to another master program, I really needed this. You are doing a good job going back to your bachelor's studies. 

Everyone should remember, not everyone's situation is the same to graduate by 21 and achieve everything in life. 

Life is not a straight line. Question : What you do for living? I started college in 2013 when I was 18 I got Btech IT by 22 I had lost interest in most things was probably depressed and also took the bold decision to drop out of college instead of giving make up exams because of  very low attendance coz I was busy playing dota and other games,drinking,rolling and watching every fucking TV series  now 2 years later beyond the depression and being looked down upon I feel ok the first year after dropping out was he'll coz I didn't have any friends back in hometown and my parents kept telling at me all day to learn my dad's work and look after it.i used to think how fckin shit I was couldnt do Btech , anyone can do Btech these days wtf, slowly I started going outside doing some of my dad's work made friends.im 24 now and life is better I still think about my fucked up life decisions.i dunno if I'll ever go back to get some degree but thanks for the motivation. Small milate jao, large banate jao Thanks for being an inspiration man. For many wonder only few do. 24 year old here... gonna start my masters in Computer Applications or get into Med School.

I was the guy who had been completely destroyed by depression. I passed my +2 in 2013 and even after 6 years, I was unable to join any college.

This year, I have come out with flying colours.. so much so that my family is baffled.

&#x200B;

Never Give Up!

&#x200B;

I hope you achieve the dreams you're striving for. thanks bro , i am struggling with CA at the age of 27.
i was confused tensed dont know wt to do but your post was a welcomed perspective to me thank you 
Godspeed to you bro !! People like you are rare who build themselves. You are destined for something big in a unprecedented future. I can't say where you are going to reach, but your spirit is telling me you're going pretty far. Oh wow this is my favorite post. Thanks for sharing it with us. ""Age is just a number, prison is just a room.""



Jk, Good luck bro. I wish u all the best. bhaii jo sahii lagta haii wo kar; bhaad mein jaye duniya [deleted] If you are doing CS, then I would recommend you go down a different path
-  Look at MIT course fundamentals for CS
-  Look at CS jobs and pick up any lang. or field -
- Get the best at it and end up writing a lot of open source projects
- Get hired at small startup and work your way up

Hands on is more critical and you would have had 4 years exp while learning a lot more working. The only way I would suggest you do engineering is if you are looking to follow that with MS and going down research path. If your end goal is to get job and work in IT, this is more than enough. Best of luck bro. Best of luck! Stick in there. Did you consider opting for an open university course, like IGNOU? Good luck.. Congratulations!!!! I am your same age, I dropped out of BDes in the first year in 2012. I did BCom on correspondence and now I'm going to do my Masters! 

When I did start my BDes course, I had at least 3 other people who had done their BTech and then come for BDes. They were 24-25 at the time and it wasn't the least bit weird. they fit right in, we loved their input and ideas. You'll be that person in your college! 

You'll have more worldly experience, more stories to say and hey you can act 20 years old and thatll be okay! (I still act like that sometimes when I say stupid things and jump around like a kid) 

Good luck on your degree! All the best buddy!

I don't know if I can be of any help to you, but just wanted to let you know that I have been a developer for about 5 years now, so if you need any help in knowing about any learning resources, or getting something done, or just general industry trends in the field, I just might know a few things that maybe of use to you.

I'll always be happy to help! Brave move man. best of luck. Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exams. Quick! Get some experience and money then begin a IT start up. The only thing I can tell you is that just dont depend on degree, get your CERTIFICATES with proper training.

I don't know much about the current requirements and trends in IT field but as far as I know, go for AWS. That's the beauty of Computer Science.Any body can learn and code!There are no boundaries , no silos , no walls.Kudos to you for dusting off and getting back on your feet.Remember,no one is bothered that you have lost time,it's only you against your past. Check out this roadmap\[1\] what you need to learn to get a good internship but this is no way an exhaustive list but from my experience this good enough to get a decent internship focus more on projects and attend hackathons. 

&#x200B;

\[1\] [https://roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) Misread it as Betch degree. Wish you all the best, brother Man you gave me goosebumps and hope. I am currently doing my Btech I don't have any backlogs but my GPA isn't good either, I am too afraid I won't get a job. Bhai lore jao.. Jaa hobe dekha jabe... Enjoy Can people without a degree get a job in web development in India?? If so is there growth for him in that job? I have seen a lot of blogs about getting a job (in developed countries) in computer science field without a degree but how much of it is true in India?? Can someone working or hiring answer this please? Hats off man. I'm sure you will succeed at anything you try if you apply yourself. You have the brilliance and even more importantly the determination not to give up. Best wishes. Good Luck!! Best of luck buddy. It's really good to see that you have taken that step, wish you all the best for your future, but at the same time i feel that if you are planning to take web dev as a career option then there are many certifications out there, for which you have to attempt examinations, going to college for 4 years seems like a huge burden to me apart from that college is expensive as fuck.

However i will also say, you know more than me, I am just a teen here with 0 life exp. but thought this could be a better option MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.... A thought out focused attempt at 25 is far far better then a attempt at 18 which is everything but focused. Apna time apne pace le chalta hain, don't let anyone shame you on that. Good luck Only in India people fucking expect you to start engineering right after school. I think we should all take time and pursue after giving it a thought. I saw this video on Harvard law school where this girl used to do a job and only after proper thinking she decided to pursue law because she loved it. This was uplifting! All the best You are very courageous dude. I wish you success and I hope you didnt completely drop photography. All the best brother. Fuck what they think. Dude cheers! For fighting depression and staring once again. Only strongest can do. Thanks for sharing this and wish you all the best bud! > I really love front end web development at the moment.

I'm a frontend developer. If you need any sort of help, I'll be happy to do it. All the best buddy :) You're amazing. I'm doing my post grad right now. I was already a year older than majority of my classmates in school. And I took a drop last year. The thought of me being a couple of years or maybe even 3 years older than my classmates, was in the back of my mind. &nbsp;

This post is improving my confidence. &nbsp;

I wish you the best OP. All the best OP. This is, of course, is big call in the context of our society. Hope it pays off for you. You know you'll be at an advantage compared to others because of the added maturity in mindset and approach you might take in studying. Wish you the absolute best, bro. Wish u all the best Thank you for this post. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

This was like a slap in the face. The mistakes that you mentioned people make, I've made them all and then some. Whereas you've overcome your situation with determination, I had slipped more into  depression due to my failure. Now I feel old and not ready to start anew. I confess that this post will not fill me with new energy but I will wholeheartedly pray for your success. you will be more mature and will waste less time. and am here 22 think too old to get education dont have any degree only high school pass wanna study something but still dont know what should i study.

[removed] I sincerely hope nothing but the best for you ! Hope you have a successful and fulfilling career ahead . All the best bro All the best to you! Don't let this determination in you fade ever! :D Great man Good luck man I'm 40 and I never went to college. It made no difference. You just need to recognise that a degree and education are different things. Don't let the fear of not having a degree be your primary motivator. Good luck and happy hacking :) Hey bro, let me start by saying that you're doing an incredible job completing your graduation. With that said, I'm sorry about your father and I hope he's doing okay now.
I was pursuing Btech in Chemical Automation and Diagnostics, dropped in my third year 2013, was 22, started with B.Com this year, would be 29 when I graduate, so I'd say I'm pretty much in the same boat as yours. I'm still trying to figure out what should I do in regards with my career, but in the meanwhile picked up SQL, now preparing for MTA and JLPT N3, both of which I'll attempt next year.


>Failure at 25

FWIW, you're definitely not a failure, for, I know you'll make it big very soon. All the more power to my man! God speed to you. This post should be posted in r/getmotivated as this is what real motivation is. Brother, here's hoping for a great future! That attitude in our society is such bullshit. When I was in the US, I encountered so many >25 year olds and even 30 and aboves who had enrolled into business school or engineering school just because they couldn't do it earlier or because they just wanted an additional skill in their reportoire.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Kudos to you man and best of luck! My wishes with you brother.


Here is all you need to know about web development.
https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap You gonna be fucking happy in 4 years. [deleted] And here I was being depressed because I couldn't get into IIT ..... Great work man.... Keep it up You did right thing bro.
Let me know if you ever need any career advice on software engg. I wish you the very best... You are an inspiration to human being..
👍👍 Good luck bro you will do awesome in life keep learning You go! 

Remember it needs a lot of guts to go against the conventions set by society, you will definitely do something big in the future!

May God Bless you! feel you bro!. I'm in the same boat. Passed 12th in 2014,failed in physics theory. Couldn't clear my 12th and neet in later years too cuz instead of study I used to smoke weed later on Charas till LCD+had lots of issues with myself too until 2018,appeared for 12th again from State board. Took admission in tier 3 college for botany(H) at the age of 22. I feel like a shit most of the time,lots of advice went unheard from my side cuz I wanted to do me,tried not to keep regrets. Funny I did ended up taking up bsc course that my dad said I should've taken,wasted my time. So I feel I've failed them and my only option for me to make it up to them is to qualify some government exams, hopefully UPSC,IFoS. But it's scary in comparison to medical lookin' for job prospect in botany cuz I don't know what too look,where to look,all I've ever seen a botany graduate that they end up in teaching jobs and plus given my history and age I might not be able to score some decent job,everyone around me has completed their study doing job while I'm still studying,it sucks. Well I don't know what future holds for me but meanwhile i'm focusing on what's infront of me,slowly building. I'm still learning to believe in myself and trust my abilities. Rest I leave upto universe, dont know where it will but I have gotta put effort into it.

Sorry for any mistakes,i'm not really good at grammar portion of english,I can just make sentences that make sense in my head😬  Due to financial conditions, I have to do teaching job after my masters and have to be a private teacher for more than a year until I collected enough money for my B.Ed. Many batchmates of mine have commplised many things now but here I am fighting my own battle. All the best! I needed this kind of motivation badly. All the best for the future 👍 this post needs an award!Proud of you brother,it takes courage and i can relate to this as i have been going through a similar phase..All the best! Doing this requires courage. I am glad you shared your story. This is inspiring :) 
ALL THE BEST!!!

My brother is in the same boat as you are. Although he is just 22. He qualified JEE in 2017, but decided that engineering was not his cup of coffee and wanted to study law. He tried those exams as well and got into a decent college, but 2 years down the line he started questioning his decision... He had interest in computer science as well and he used to code sometimes even when he was pursuing law. 

Now when he started to realize that law was not for him, we discussed a lot, pros and cons of this decision and he decided he wants to pursue computer science. So he started college yesterday. Best of luck bro. Fuck the society and go for what you feel is the best for you. I can so relate to the fact that it is expected to do all things in a certain pattern and by a certain age. Hope you succeed and do well! This post is proof that you don't need a degree to be educated. This post made my day. 
Wishing the best for you! 
You’re awesome! ♥️ Well, there's a Master's candidate at my University who has a daughter doing her bachelor's Best of luck friend Indian society is full of fucking wankers. Forget about them and pursue what you desire. The only opinions that matter are those of the ones you love. Nobody cares what the society thinks. Kudos for taking the plunge. All the best! Kudos to you my man. Such an inspiring story. 

I too studied chemical engineering, though not at 25. It wasn't for me either and I ended up depressed. Took a year off after bachelors and am gonna study physics now. 

I could learn a thing or two from you. Keep up your spirit and fuck the naysayers. You made my day⊂(◉‿◉)つ Bookmarking this. Best of luck in life bro. Congratulations to you for making such a bold move. To do what you are doing certainly requires courage. You are an inspiration to the young generation that gives up their life over some petty issues. And the society we live in is also kinda judgmental. Having said that, you must be receiving support as well.Now that you are embarking on new journey of your life, wish u all the happiness and luck. You go man.. ain't no shame in pursuing what you want to.. good luck.. I would say you could have done a 3 year BSC or BCA instead of BTech from a tier 3 college. You could have saved some money and a graduate degree one year early. Then again more power to you for doing something what you like. Great attitude man, our society adds unecessary stigmas to everything, just do what you are doing and don't give a fuck about what everyone else has to say. I takes courage to beat the cliche in this Indian society and pursue what you love. May the force be with you. I am happy for you!!! :D Good Luck. All the Best That was perfect, godspeed. I hope you are successful in all your endeavours. You never failed. You just got a break so that the universe could mold you into a better person. And stop comparing apples with oranges. It doesn’t help. I am glad that you never gave up. ♥️ >  I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. 

That's not a valid comparison. India education system is all handholding and spoonfeeding. Great going dude. Keep it up👍🏻 Just applied for MBA in correspondence, there is no age to learning, Your doing the correct thing, All the best bro!!! First year is the toughest so focus on clearing them, after that you can apply for internship/ job at local web development firms. 
As your college is tier 3, they won't mind your job as their main concern is fees, they'll let you attend job without problem. 
I am asking you do job is because industry experience is highly appreciated by MNCs and also because tier 3 colleges don't provide the required guidance and are far away from realities of what's going on in the industry. All the very best bro 🤘 All the best brother.  God  bless you on your new path. Chutiya lodo pe dhyan na de, God bless. Good luck. I'm 29, and have backlogs still. Wish I could do something and get a degree soon. 

Keep up the good work bro, more power to you! ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽 Would strongly urge you to learn python and big data. I know you are passionate about front end but to leap to salaries your peers are earning you need to give a chance to technologies which are and will be in demand. Kudos to you for being brave. Thanks for this inspirational post. You have broken the stereotypical lifestyles that most of us lead  and I hope things work our well for you from now on :-) Thank you for sharing this.  Indians need to change this idea of ""this only happens at a normal age"".  Your never too late to start! Good luck! Better late than never, my friend. Sir u are an inspiration for a lot of students out there. I studies subjects in school and college that I had no interest in but had to study cuz i wouldn't be able to find a job with the subjects of my choice. Breaking past the social stigma is a surely a daunting task but not an impossible one. Good luck. Guys if u think the degree matter to do something in life? only positive story i find in this group. i will refer you to big 4 when you graduate. humanity is dying this is inspiration. Well..for all I know if my Jee plan backfires so does my neet  plan..I could still try again GREAT, more courage to you dude. I myself thinking of doing masters in technology, I am past my 30. Never stop learning. Drop me a message if you want to do internship in frontend development. Most of my friends are CTOs and Lead Frontend at various startups, I can get them to give you a solid experience. Good luck on the journey. You sir, is simply the one we want right now.

You are copying something that is much more valuable from the Western culture Brightens my day FULL POWER SCOTTY GET THOSE KLINGONS Thank you for sharing your story, it will surely help me :) Good luck!! you are never too old to learn Dude in all honesty, really proud of you for listening to your heart and taking the proper decision. 25 is young bro! We believe in you my man! Thanks brother for sharing your experiences. My relatives always try to make me feel like a looser when I dropped one year for a better college and try to compare with their son that I used to be one year ahead now I am in the same year as him. :/ Great job brother! All the best to you All the best dude! Hope you’re successful with your degree and in life, in general! As someone who's pursuing CA and is in a similar position, thank you for making this post. If only my relatives stopped pestering my parents about my age and my parents in turn didn't label me as a loser for years, I would've been a different person today. I've literally stopped going out to family functions or keep in touch with such relatives and friends (sadly, everyone) who's only opinion on you is to compare and be judgemental. Reading your post has inspired me to do what I'm doing without paying heed to what society says. After all one has lost only when one gives up. My friend who's in Europe currently for masters said it's common to have students who are 30+ in masters, even bachelor's and nobody blinks an eye.. so unlike our Indian society. I wish you all the best and I hope we make the best out of our respective situations. Thank you so much for this. I recently changed my major in college to economics so I'll have to stay an extra year to be able to complete my credits and honestly I get made fun of a lot for that because I'll be the only one not graduating on time. It made me so happy to see this. Good luck to you too! 25 is a young age! When I was doing my undergrad, over the course of my 4 years, I’ve come across people in their 50s and 60s attending classes and trying to get a degree!
And yeah, they were really good at their work. Read Btech as Bitch, that's all I am 24, and I have enrolled myself into a BA (Economics) course. I dropped out of [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Mechanical three years back. Reading this gave me hope. Thank you. Wish you all the best with your career! May you get an awesome job after finishing your course. Good for you, age is just a number. Never too late to keep learning.  Forget what society says. If you don't take charge of your life, other people will. Good luck mate. I'm graduating at age 23. Brother! This post of yours right here, this shined a light through my bleak day!

You ARE A CHAMPION!ONE OF THE BRAVEST!Wisest as well!

That must have been a hell of a plunge to take, and you fucking took it!!
I hope you find what you want to do and what you excel in brother!!! Age is a number bro. People around the world go back to college when they feel like it and when they can financially foot the bill.

You will make a better and more mature engineer You are really an inspiration for many people. Even my mother completed her under graduate degree when my elder sister was in 10th standards. She was struggling every now and then to educate us and now we all are earning, she wants to leave her job and pursue more education! After reading your post, it's proved once again that to get knowledge-age does not matter! I don't have any rewards, but here is your gold! 🥇 I don’t have an award so here you go. All the best, sir.

Never feel down, brother. And if you ever do, hit me up in the PM's, I'll be there to talk to you.

P.S. - Saved this post to track your progress, do give us updates! r/india itself has a big comp sci grad population to ask to if you need help I'm proud of you, macha. Please don't delete this post, cause I've saved it and I want to look back at it from time to time for inspiration. You are on your own timeline, no one matters.
I messed up my first try at B.tech(Completely my fault. I fucked up big time.) I turned my life around when I was 21, joined a 3rd tier college, completed b.tech Cse this year, got placed in Mindtree. TCS, Wipro did not let me sit on campus drive for my gap years. I had three other offer letters except Mindtree, now looking forward to excel myself more.

All the best to you. It's  good to hear that you're from West Bengal, are you Bengali too? Bring future awaits my friend Good luck Bhalo laglo eta pore! Egiye jao bro Man you just motivated me to prepare for NEET again just as I made up my mind to give up. Our life should not be scheduled according to our age as societal norms force us to do. May you succeed in all your endeavors. ✌☮ And I'm a retard who took a drop from 12th last year... I laugh at it now XDD but I think whatever happened... happened for a reason now I'm completing 12th this year and boy the maturity i feel now towards study is unmatchable by a regular 16-17yr old 12th student. Man, I love seeing posts like this on this sub. You are part of the new India which looks beyond judging people for things like going back to school. Good luck! I hope you enjoy what you do and never regret any of it. Just finished my first year of undergrad. Turned 24 during it. Yes, fucking cunties and cuntkles talk, but fuck them man we got this. 

All the power to you dude, good to know there's more of us around :D Just want to say, I started school at 23 after a not so good 18-23. 25 now graduate next fall. Just keep with it. Make friends, have fun. Its ok to have fun but don't be stupid. Indian here in America, I am about to graduate with my bachelors at the age of 25. I definitely understand the pressure of not being graduated especially in the Indian circles. That’s mostly why I choose not entertain the people who judge me. Those that mind don’t matter, those that matter don’t mind 😊 Ganbarimasu, senpai! I'm finishing it at 28 🙌👏 Your moto is your username 😂, have a great college life bro Best of luck to you man.Depression is one hell of a thing to get through.Stay strong buddy ✌️ You've got photography basics clear, use that to be a developer who writes code with design sense. Example, coding for apps about photo filters...(even courses like image processing from electrical department would help)  Or more generically, even front end designing could be your thing. You don't necessarily need to take it as fresh start. Use your past. More avenues will be visible once you connect these things.

Being a master's dropout, i think I'm able to learn more without college (also saving on money if that's a factor). Yes, job hunt will get difficult... which is why make a coherent story (you got curious about designing while being a photographer and decided to work on that skill.)

Still, given that you have a different pace/way, no need to get more societal validation in form of degree. Save that course money and spend it on your own thing. Because you're picking CSE, this particular skill can be easily learnt from internet. 

I'm almost saying- why give more chance to education system that failed to empathize first time? (However much you think it was your fault, it wasn't). The system is still the same. Use your time to do plenty other things in the world. [deleted] Doing my post graduation at the ripe age of 35, I can totally relate. Feel like a fish out of water. Other than what your studies , get into the open source world. Start understanding programming concepts, try building some stuffs on your own, post them to GitHub. Rinse and repeat. 

For any help related to programming or web development in general you can reach out to the below communities.

/r/webdev
/r/programming
/r/learnprogramming I have finished both my gold and silver. Else this would have been my proud gilding. All the best brother. I am a CSE graduate from a tier 3 private college in kolkata and trust me when I say this: the placement scenario here is not at all good, largely due to the quality of faculty and poorly structured WBUT/MAKAUT curriculum, which in turn translates to poor quality students, hence do not rely on college placements. If you're interested in coding and comp sci in general, explore outside the curriculum (be active on hackerrank, spoj, explore ML, Blockchain, contribute to open source projects and so on). Doing so would help you make it to the bar of the top product companies which pay much better and have a lot better work than the mass recruiting companies that hire from these colleges. [deleted] You are actually in quite an envious position. You are much more mature than the other graduates, you know the world out there so I don't think you would be negligent in your studies. I would say go give it your all and all the best! 

P.S - I would suggest you get started on your studies now, it would be really easy to score an awesome job right after graduation of you start now. Pick up competitive programming or anything... Try freelancing, try out everything. That's a great achievement . Wish you more bright days in life . Fuck Indian society [deleted] I'm an engineering dropout, I've missed out three years there, I can totally feel you bro, love and support, you'll be doing great for sure. Keep boosting up I went to college after a 2 year gap after my 12th and had a lot of apprehensions about it so I can only imagine what you’re going through. But over a period of time I met a lot of people and post an initial period of judgment - which I think was more of me being ashamed of my gap than those who I was meeting for the first time ever - I made some of my best friends who made the 4 years some of the best of my life. Long story short, it’s gonna be epic! Good luck :)"
Photography,"Photographers of India: I need photography Assistance/Suggestions. Can you guide me on how to begin in this field? Are there any good upcoming Photography workshops/talks/courses,etc?",5,bm2lmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bm2lmt/photographers_of_india_i_need_photography/,3,"3 questions :
1. Which DSLR Camera to invest in?
2. Photographers who can guide and help me through, I am willing to assist and work under you. (I will be staying in Mumbai in the month of June.)
3. Any workshops/talks/courses I can attend? 


Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.",gotmylifetogether," Don't know where you are from, sorry, but this field is really, really overbooked.

For me, a single photographer has no future in India, my best advice will be : make a team and join an elder. 

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS) Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well. Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

Also post the pictures on instagram (Have a proper account dedicated to photography), a lot of people I know were recognised for their talent sooner or later this way."
Photography,Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,130,dcqkjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcqkjk/watching_movies_in_india_is_a_truly_unique/,54,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.",sleepygamer92," We live in a society Is the photographer Auditya of Audi photography by any chance ? I remember watching The Dark Knight in theater, it was mostly empty and my friends were kinda making fun of me for watching comic book movie. From that to Heath Ledger face painted Joker anarchists, I am kinda glad :) Sounds like a fun night! Aur ek main hun jo WAR chala gaya

Sorry dosto Joker ke english subtitles nahi they . Apun partially deaf hai [deleted] Is the film cursed or what. Everyone going there is having troubles. 

Nah nah I think the cinema is cursed.

Or maybe OP is, considering this many unfortunaties happening in one go [removed] Holy shit all of those in a single show? Where is this? hahaha here's what I experienced yesterday watching the movie:

1) dude in front of me got a huge popcorn bucket and well, he annoyed me throughout the movie

2) in this brooding serious movie, bunch of guys and girls howled, whistled and clapped when arthur fleck finally got the joker makeup, and then when he got the bloody smile. I felt like I was watching a Sallu bhai movie

3) girl behind said after the movie ended : DC waale bahut weird movie hi banate hai. No. 3 I hate it when people start making videos of movie to upload to their insta status,  no one f**kin cares what movie you are watching unless it's Mia Khalifa's comeback video playing in imax. 

No. 4. It can legit happen to anyone anywhere in the world but people need to learn the courtesy of going out before taking calls or put the frikkin thing on silent and enjoy the movie I bet /r/bollywood might also like this Whenever I go to watch a CGI-fest at the multiplex, I keep hearing audience on the way extolling how Christopher Nolan is the greatest film director ever. Basic human empathy tells you not to say shut up to someone who is clearly going through sudden emotional trauma. Imagine yourself in his shoes. Other than that, haha. >Dunno why these people worship The Joker.

It's the kind of people who don't get the message from the movie. It's not just Joker though, although he is definitely the biggest idol for the incel culture on the internet. These people also think Rorschach, Tyler Durden, Travis Bickle etc. were the good guys in their movies What the fuck. But you know what, I've watched movies in some shady-ass neighborhoods of North America and some of this applies to those cinemas as well."

But eight-hour shoots. Sigh. Haha bichu This article is hilariously depressing. Why keralites are so obsessed with this cringy photo shoots , don't get me wrong out of 10 such pre wedding photography , atleast 6 of them would be from Kerala or Punjab. There is a youtube black hole ""Kerala wedding videos"". Recently I saw one with guy and girl on a helipad with wind blowing and stuff. Looks like shot on a drone but couldn't figure out where the photographer was standing. It was seriously some bollywood level choreography.  Water conservation just went up the arse I can't believe they wanted to stand around for 8 hours after a tiring  8 hours. Some shoots are tolerable, while others are cringy AF with slow mo etc... I feel this hoopla around pre-wedding shoots, honeymoons, likes on social media etc. take away people's thoughts from real feelings and intentions w.r.t. marriage.  What happened to fake rain for Delhi? I have seen quite a few drone videos of Telugu pre-wedding shoots. Didn't know it's a big thing in Kerala as well. If everyone is happy, good for them. Validation from social media. It's huge now.
Birthdays, wedding and even funerals.  Seen quite a few pictures of dead bodies kept as whatsapp/instagram status just minutes after the demise. 

Pre-wedding photoshoots are supercringe.

You know what's even more hilarious. There are 15-20 minutes long pre-wedding videos with Bollywood stories and Bollywood songs uploaded on YouTube."
Photography,[Photography] Durga Pooja celebration aftermath (Delhi),253,9p62k4,https://imgur.com/KJQjz2J,32,,Don_Ank," Most of such pandals never have dustbins, people do use dustbins when they are accessible. Though agreed there are some people with negligible civic sense who'll litter anyway and it should be partly a responsibility of organisers to clean afterwards. NDMC and other civil authorities could also ask for money that covers cost of such event held in a public place and the cleanup required afterwards. This is what I hate about us Indians. :(

On the other hand, I would like to share that I have seen sikhs doing langar sewa and cleaning afterwards. Everyone should learn from them. This is the situation post any celebration... be it a festival or a wedding or a party

I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where?

**India top-ranked country in mobile data consumption: Amitabh Kant**

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Respect! Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!!

Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,6,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",kasam_se," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. "
Science/Technology,"OnlineRTI on Twitter: ""RTI CIC appointment - Modi Government invites anyone with wide experience in law, science, technology etc.""",46,2k9t1b,https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI/status/525916977898860544,8,,onlinerti," The Central Information Commission, the Court for hearing RTI cases, has been left without a Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) for almost a month.

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

Please help me by answering a short survey here: [http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U](http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U).

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",happy_elephant," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

I support you..very nice initiative.

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  

How much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k? 

Surely you can afford that much money."

> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‘issue’ after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as “American basmati”.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like “Kasmati” and “Texmati”.

> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) — Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also

Recently i believe there was news of a company trying to patent pattals or leaf bowls and plates there which we use for prashad and bhandara. Every time someone tells me about why patenting is good for inventors and protects their interests which is kind of true, I remind them of all the ways it’s abused and used to bully actual pioneers who just aren’t aware of the law. Anyone who has prepared for NEET knows the story [deleted] They even tried to patent our 'Pranayama'; they got it renamed to 'Cardiac Coherence Breathing'. Ain't this old news?

Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year. 

One simple computer vision app can replace this entire job function (when I was working there, there were around 10 others who were doing the same thing, with different components)"
Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",arkoprovo1996,
Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,7,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",officialshebu," Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :)  Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.

Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow. Can we also use the argument in OP's post to explain how so little engineering is actually done in india and how many of the ""engineering"" firms are just glorified contractors? http://408perceptions.blogspot.com/2016/08/engineering-in-inida-is-waste-of-time.html whatch this article

People there at large feel the man is not at all qualified for the job and students are planning for a massive protest against the high-handed appointment. There was no prior consultation was faculty member there whatsoever.

Now I did some digging and found out there seems to be pattern amongst all of the recent appointments.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",Responsbile_Indian," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",nerds_revenge," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it."

Only if Mr. Buffalo could lawyer up and sue Ms Cow for defamation and slander. I have seen cows crusted in shit eating shit sticking around each other's bum. Cow ""will not stand or sit around dirty place"" indeed. It's like these people refuse to see what's happening right in front of their eyes. Or if they see it, just say cowdung is clean, and there you are. Wait, has UNESCO already approved this? How does indian beef taste compared to the US ? What the hell is Active sense??

FUCK YOU FIITJEE. It's a shame that we don't have laws governing who gets to use terms like ""University"" or ""academy"". >FIITJEE

Fuck IITJEE
 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year. Krishna killed a bunch of people after lyying to them. I doubt he gives a fuck about shit like poaching faculty. नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।

उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ।। Salem Hypothesis - People who believe in God(creationism) and are men of science are likely to be engineers than Scientists.
 If I hate this ad... Will I go to hell ?  +1 on fiitjee is cancer. Studied there full time for 2 years only to realize that my time and self confidence was wasted Meh, its advertising. End of the day they will still teach science only Its a private company, it can do what it wants, right? People can just choose not to go there. The ad is deplorable. But Fiitjee is way better than narayana and chaitanya. Atleast where I studied. We live in a 1.3 billion society where 50% of the population is under 25. Blame the competition and lack of resources to educate the students. Peer pressure just adds depression into this primordial soup. 

When I studied in fiitjee (did not clear iitjee but got into a well known college) . There were no extra classes and we were taught Just the subject and given phase books. (8 phases in 2 years). You get into a good college if by yourself are motivated to study harder. Peer pressure kept us on our toes. Their material is good. More importantly, I learned to practice self-discipline. Something that was very useful when I entered college. I saw so many burned out people in IIT tanking their GPA from other  pre-university institutes.  Dude every iit jee Institute is like that all are fuckin pricks and sometimes even teachers are racists  Kalyug isn't an *idea*, it's a cosmological time-frame described in the Vedic literatures.

Science/Technology,India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,190,e6ekhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6ekhy/india_needs_to_invest_more_in_education_and/,53,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",thruaway593," The priorities of the people and (so) of the government are wrong. The government wants to invest in Bullet train. Their priorities are Ram Mandir, Ram Setu, Ram Lalla, Cow Mata, Yoga, Havan, Yagna, etc. It is a clueless government elected by clueless people. They won't invest in education and healthcare. In fact the people of India will not elect a party that sets healthcare and education its priority. They will elect a party that promises to bomb Pakistan or throw the Muslims in the sea. You should not have great expectations from 1.3 billion simpletons. I will keep it simple, when people don't have jobs and education, they are easy to manipulate. That is not going to change because its profitable Basically, we need Kejriwal as the PM If the govt. Invests more in healthcare and education, it is leftist, communist, marxist and what not. If we go by the ammount of young population here, good education will change the country (in a goodway ofc) in no time. If you invest in education, where will you find new bhakts? The education  budget used to me more. 

The govt. Has been gradually reducing it since 2014.  

Priorities. We invested 1% of our GDP last year on health care

&#x200B;

Let this sink in. >Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

The priorities of a supply side regime has always ever been in cutting social expenditure on the side of people.

Why so? Now you can look at classical economics, and try to find what the supply side economics really stand for.

An auction market, where people have ""fair idea of wages and price levels and rights""

Now, you have to question where from can the source of such exploitation be? 

In any case the classical position is that demand will balance itself out (which is a pretty bad argument, I will say), and the effect of government spending is crowding out of investment (which is again a problematic position). So, it has to be G = T, if the equilibrium has to be maintained. And in classical supply side economics, the only way to spurs growth, is to shift the Ns and Nd meeting point far eastwards, with maximum N and minimal real wage, given Y = F (K,N). In order to do that, you need to provide tax cuts, to the richest. Government intervention is doom for them and their market system runs of ""no rights for the employees"" because it is a supply side constraint.

Now you will ask me why am I saying all this, because its really not relevant.

The source of exploitation in the auction market situation is highly imperfect knowledge on the part of the employees (am not saying this, Alfred marshall said this). Now, even the best of capitalists knew that the access of the average worker to the ""education, knowledge, and henceforth rights"" would remain constrained and he would basically be entrapped as ""a labour"", albeit skilled one, with low negotiation power in the face of industry.

The idea of vile maxim and goodwill of the entrepreneur thus was put in the graveyard along with adam smith. Only invisible hand remained.

Public access to education being low, always enables a supply side oligopolist/monopolist to enjoy huge control on the labour. Education, as in education and not just being skilled labor is antithetical to capitalist interests. Little wonder victorian era education wanted man to be an educated slave. Not a leader. Little wonder leadership crisis is real, across nations and across industries.

>Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

>It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak.

Beyond it, its also very gendered. Like take the PLFS and NSSO surveys, the degree of fall in WPR of women, was almost 18% from 2005 to 2018. (Above 15 y of age). Now the average ""bhagwa"" apologist reply is that, see, people must be earning better so girls are in homes. Thus, I decided to look deeper into indices, and an article too confirmed that unemployment, in the poorest expenditure decile fell from 30.8 to 16.5%. 

I took rural women and the lowest expenditure decile to clearly show, that how the lack of education directly affects employability. In this case, lets find out how a govt intervention holds a decent case 

For one, the avg woman selling sabzi in the mandis would rather want to save the extra penny rather than send her daughter to the ""private"" school. She simply cannot afford. And the tragedy of the govt schools is that most lack any decent investment and govt spending. The solution is not privatisation. The solution isn't tax cuts. But to increase govt expenditure per GDP to schools.


>However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable

See, firstly let me tell you this unemployable thing is a horrible joke. India has seen a jobless growth for years. Since 1991. The interest of the firms is profit maximization. So they would retrench people for suitable technology and ask for no minimum wages. You have to understand whether there is a definite need of

A. Corporate accountability fixation? Wherein you should be answerable for the tax cuts you bag in the name of skilling and run some namesake skipping programs, mired with fraud?

B. Corporate entity as a social entity. A corporation must yield to the social contract on the basis of which it exists in the society, or it should have no existence.

C. Prevention of corporate centralization. Or rather monopoly or oligopoly. In which case they fix the norms. 

D. Corporatization of education. Here you have to ask a lot of things, beyond the top 3

One, the affordability of the higher education system. In case one takes away grants, we will literally see the IITs being super expensive wherein the average bloke won't be able to afford it. 

Two, keeping the education sector as free space,as spaces where criticism is allowed. Nowadays, the idea is that you can freely bash the non majoritarian idea (political, economic anything) but whatever comes in direct contradiction to the interests of the cronies is censored out. It might be your book on baba ramdev, or some documentary by chomsky or anything.

Three, killing the art of questioning. This is definitely missing in our syllabus in india, as the most important virtue that's expected of you, is to obey. Now, corporate centralization will be a massive danger, as AV classes with animations become the norm and teachers become obsolete. The students will be required to learn what comes with the package that some company is making. That might be dangerous. Because that doesn't tell the full story. 

Fourth and most definitely this, is the rampage for marks. That's also very equal to what we do in economics, regurgitate growth, as if it is the panacea. No it isn't. The time has come to move on towards better testing procedures that test your ability to analyse what you have studied. Open book tests. Adaptive tests. 

Fifth, and lastly, the threat to critical analysis from corporatocracy. That's exactly what you see when you see when people say 30 year phd in JNU and news channels run it. Par Mandir kahan banayeinge? But first political parties have to save Hindus from Muslims and vice-versa! Eat

In your first year, you are not allowed to have laptops. Also very minimal interaction with seniors. 

Also I have heard that you get a scholarship for your tuition throughout but have to maintain a certain GPA, else you'll have to pay them the fees. And if you maintain the GPA, and ISRO is looking for engineers, you will have to join them unless you buy them out by paying the whole course fee.

Science/Technology,"Scientists of India, ministry of science and technology wants you for research on Yoga & meditation",94,70mzlx,https://imgur.com/NF5ee1Y,23,,pakaomat," [deleted] Though myself vehemently oppose the zabardasti ka superior kulcha line. I have no issues with proper scientific research done to prove the benefits or ills of said kulcha.  The only problem I see is that the research will be done in a shoddy manner and hence be a waste of money. This is actually much needed. There are so many neuroscience studies on the effect of drugs, videogames, sex, tv, facebook etc on our brains - but different forms of meditation are not as studied. Each one would yield different results. It's time these were scientifically scrutinized.

 The only question is whether unsatisfactory results will be allowed to be published. > SATYAM

This government sure knows how to spin creative acronyms. Very welcoming! We should do more research on this rather than Harvard or Stanford.
There is a lot of research that these two institutions do inspite of yoga being an Indian thing. We should try to match them. Where's the problem OP? There are already many international universities researching the benefits of meditation on the brain. Why shouldn't India do it? Don't expect me to spit on something just because it's connected to religion and you have problems with it. *Disclaimer: If the paper shows yoga and meditation have no major impact on health The Truth Ministry will make sure the researcher get Vyapamed™. Please read the terms and conditions carefully before applying. BMJK. OP you are a scumbag. This project might actually help in getting rid of dumb pseudoscience and superstition associated with yoga and ayurveda. Stop dissing on Indian culture and arts just cos they dont fit your worldview, you goddamn pseudo-secular self-hating commie fake-liberal fake-scientific thinker. I dont mind the request from the ministry , what i worried here is how much of these research are going to be genuine , as there is more chance , few of the research later on can be used by this govt to support yoga and meditation being implemented ...like say while watching a movie in a theatre... Soon Research Proposals for Cow Dung and Gau mutra  Whatever Yoga & Meditation might be, they are definitely NOT science and technology.

Science/Technology,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,501,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1454,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

[Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQyV2WGmvOs)",freddledgruntbugly," At the ISRO press conference Did you guys hear the angry journalist barking "" where is the chairman, why is he not facing the press"".... As if he has fled away after a scam. Such a scumbag. Ok so some retards are already out with ""wAstAge of PublIc rEsoUrces iN a CountrY oF PoVerTy"" rhetoric, here's the thing.  
  
Total mission cost was 900 cr, a minuscule portion of total budget  
  
India doesn't actually spend that much money on the space program. BJP spent 27000 cr on their 2019 election campaign.  
 
India's space program actually helps in alleviating poverty, by creating jobs, by helping farmers and fishermen by tracking weather activities, by educating poor people through EDUSat etc. It is so painful to watch the ISRO chairman crying. No matter what is the outcome, I will stand by with ISRO, and I will fight internet battles on their behalf, fuck anyone who thinks ISRO is not competent enough. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.

A quote form INTERSTELLAR [removed] What makes it all the more hard to swallow is that the country has (naively)   come to expect a near perfect track record from ISRO 

Sometimes its easy to forget that what we're experimenting with is quite literally ""Rocket Science "" Getting a nation full of people who say space programs are a waste of money to be glued to their TV sets at 2 am in the morning is an achievement in itself. 

ISRO has just inspired a lot of young minds to take up space science as a field of interest. 

Instead of youth saying I want to work at NASA, we might find them saying I want to work for ISRO.

Wake up Vikram. You have a lot more people to inspire. :) #Bruh

Like we nearly did it. I am still very proud! 👍👍 That journalist Pallava Bagla was a complete asshole for being so rude at the press conf Well done, ISRO!  The lander didn’t work out, but you’re still in orbit, and collecting data.  That’s a big win in itself.  Your flag will be on the surface soon enough. One kid is literally asking how to become President Personally I’m still hopeful. All the banter, name calling and vitriol aside, Godforbid if communication doesn’t get restored, you guys should really be proud of the monumental and prolonged effort and skill that went into reaching as far as you have reached. This is no small feat for a nation. Every moment of this mission has provided your scientists valuable information. Information that which was not handed to you by another country. These sort of attempts contribute in building a culture of making attempts in previously uncharted territory. We all know success greets those who make attempts. Everybody who tries something for the 1st time will be at a disadvantage, learning from it is where it’s at. Success after such setbacks is sweetest and much more meaningful. Imagine how many Indian kids in school will be inspired. Imagine how many more Indian young adults will be part of the next mission. That is how you teach a nation to dream big. Having ambitions that traverse petty human squabbles is what gives a nation its future. Today *is* a historic day for you all. It’s another chapter added to the story of India. 15-20 years from now many of you will be sharing with your kids the story of today. Be proud guys Did anyone else see the short de-briefing? The journalists absolutely hounded the speaker because the Chairperson didn't show up. Why should they act like this? [2019 so far](https://i.imgur.com/sVOzjat.png) Goosebumps moment when Pragyan's tyre tracks showed the National Emblem. I mean in the animated video explaining Pragyan's mission.

Edit: It's there in ISRO YT channel. Did a kid just ask a question about reservation? Dear scientists, we are proud of you.  🇮🇳 Space is tough. Only the Vikram has failed, the orbiter mission was successful. That too, it has lost contact. It might set back our manned moon mission a bit because this is what ISRO was trying, a soft landing. I'm sure there will be another mission soon. GG. Damn Chief do not cry. You did the best! Hopefully this teaches people that failures are part of life and should be accepted.

What an absolute cunt of a guy he is. People on the pakistani sub are also embarrassed by his lack of ingenuity.

There have been other Pakistani trolls who now see this as an opportunity to confront India. Let's make this clear, it has nothing to do with politics, its just jealousy, and hatred that can be seen embedded in their hearts.

One Pakistani guy replied to a post mocking India's achievement saying:

This also goes to us, as an Indian, as a citizen of a mature nation, we must not indulge in blatant mockery of anyone just out of bitter spite and envy.

Feel bad for K Sivan. His voice was literally shaking. Bollywood: Chaand sifarish jo karta hamari deta wo tumko btaa...

ISRO: We'll get his personal statement just hang on. Bruh I am legit feeling bad for the scientists. I have a question. Doesn't orbiter have a camera attached to it? Can't it show what actually happened to the lander? 

PS dont know much about it, was just speculating.
But literal chills. So proud!! To the people who are calling it a technology demonstration, it is not exactly a technology demonstration. Chandrayaan 1 was more of technology demonstration even though it had some good payloads. 

Chandrayaan 2 is not a technology demonstration. The orbiter is carrying many payloads and is a full fledged lunar mission in itself on par with either ESA or NASA. 

The lander too has some good payloads and the landing mission is in and itself one of the engineering target.

I've worked on the rover movement. The rover is the closest to a technology demonstration even though it carries a couple of payloads. If landing on moon was this hard for a lander, just imagine landing 3 people on moon and that too in fucking 1969 and bringing them back home safely...

How the fuc... Neil DeGrasse Tyson speaking live on Times Now. Never expected him to see on Indian television If Kerbal Space Program has taught me anything, it is to try again. Learn from your mistakes and keep at it until you succeed. I hope ISRO can make it in anothet mission. Best of luck next time! Don't cut off the feed for fuck Sake...let people see the harsh reality!

May be success or failure but let us see that! We are still proud of out scientists and everyone working on this project! [deleted] Reasons data can be lost

1. The lander malfunctioned ,went in too hard and crashed thus destroying the transmitter
2. The transmitter malfunctioned but the lander did manage to carry on and survive

&#x200B;

most likely its Number 1 , but even if the lander did manage to survive  it can't really function without data transmission ISRO Chief, K Sivan to ANI: We've found the location of #VikramLander on lunar surface and orbiter has clicked a thermal image of Lander. But there is no communication yet. We are trying to have contact. It will be communicated soon. 

https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/1170611250054627329 [removed] Windows is now rebooting to apply updates... Neil deGrasse Tyson being an absolute person of positivity. His words are so motivating. I am feeling very bad for him :( [removed] [deleted] Think of what a momentous achievement this is: to have come from a smattering of diverse cultures , pedigrees and kingdoms exploited by colonial masters to maintaining a most diverse and robust union. From being a vessel of the worlds pity to being able to emulate and in some aspects supersede the achievements of Soviets and the Americans with both our arms tied behind our backs. What we as Indians achieved here today is still significant and more than any other nation can lay claim to. The object of science is progress. We successfully launched an efficient and cost effective mission to the moon. It was ambitious and indigenous. That in itself is worth a century of pride. The certainty that we will be able to learn move on and get there next time makes me happy. The nat geo host seems to be good! Putting this mission on Livestream should only go on to show how difficult the work that the ladies and gents over at ISRO do. Immense respect for every single person involved and hope this brings more of the bright folks into the field. GG Listening to Neil Degrasse Tyson at 3 am

I count this as an absolute win Didn't feel this bad even after my math board exam ...And that exam was a fucking tragedy Bhai ₹500 jyaada le le bus land karaa de Some kid actually asked about reservation lol. F That falling short of 2.1 odd kms made me cry! Can truly understand what the ISRO scientists and staff may be going through Non-political, just an ISRO fanboy. Where can I find official ISRO merch? We need to commemorate Chandrayaan 2 forever. Ya it failed. but brighter side is that orbiter is still working absolutely perfectly. The moon is India’s backyard- Neil deGrasse Tyson From twitter @AksharPathak

[Everyone's like ""oh why is Chandrayaan landing so late in the night I won't be up to see it"", what else were you expecting ki day mein land hoga how is that possible din mein moon hota nahi you idiots.](https://twitter.com/AksharPathak/status/1170012859658489856) An expert on DD says the velocity was supposed to be 2m/s when we saw around 40m/s. Doesn't sound good. During the live descent trajectory plot that was displayed on screen it can be seen that the green line represented actual trajectory and the red line represented planned trajectory.

Could someone theorize (or attempt to explain) as to why the green dot representing the lander proceeded (and eventually stopped) until \~0.5 Km but the official announcement mentioned that communications were lost at 2.1km above the surface ?

How exactly was ISRO measuring the vertical altitude of the lander ? Might be little off topic, but i really want watch this on big screen. Portrayal of failures is as important as success. I believe they can be more inspiring considering success is build on layers of failures.
Failures are often stereotyped, i really hope someone comes up with it. Heard one of the scientists say ""kya btaogae ghar pe ?"" (""What will you inform at home ?""). This hurts man. We are proud of our scientists. They have created history. No need to lose heart. Our scientists have done a great job. 

Jai Hind!

- Arvind Kejriwal It's hard to see, after so much anticipation that we couldn't reach the mark. This would be a remarkable takeaway for ISRO and for it's quest in doing something valuable for the country. 

The mission was allocated at a cost of Rs 978 crores (which is around 141 Million dollars). 

The prime minister was there consoling the scientists. Social media has been supportive.  Every citizen has backed them! And we continue to do. The PM mentioned the moment, when the announcement was made about the 'lost in communication', the scientists received a major shock. The Pm consoled them and the emotional Chairman Mr K Sivan which was heart breaking to watch!

*..Mahn that for me shows the amount of dedication our intelligent minds put to explore the world.*

This, as I mentioned will be a major takeaway. ISRO is still trying to access communication, and we hope for the best as always.

Some have said that the whole mission should had undergone in secrecy and others object to it by saying that it takes a lot of courage to show your failures. 

*There were also people who commented on the downfall of the economy stating that India should get it's priorities right.*

We as a nation's intellectual minds proceed relentlessly towards development and major breakthroughs in the STEM field. There will always be ups and downs, like these, and it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to encourage and motivate anyone on the quest for the incredible! 


Mera Bharat Desh Mahaan! JAI HIND!!! 50 rs extra lelo bas land kara do 😒 Looks like it crash landed. There were two other communication systems in place outside of India and all three of them (ISRO+2) lost communication. Most probable cause is hardware malfunction of vikram. I hope I'm wrong though. I hope it just comes back when everyone is about to leave like in hindi movie We go again. Space is hard guys, we go again. Hope those kids don’t lose morale and take it as a challenge and pursue career in astronomy and get us success in future. group hugs y'all I am not certain but I think it was Curiosity or Opportunity Rover where NASA tried and made the rover fit inside a huge ball, think it was? And the ball just absorbed all the entry impact in Mars and then opened up for the rover to explore. Could we have tried something of that sort or am I too Naive? So the landing was guided or non guided? What bewilders me is the fact that people are so dejected with the lost communication as if it is all over. For starters, let me tell you such missions are fully automated so there is a significant possibility that the lander might be sitting duck on the moon. I strongly believe that our scientists would have a contingency plan to relay communication using the orbiter. For that we have to wait till the orbiter is in the right position. Otherwise, if the lander has crash landed on the surface then its debris would be captured by the orbiter. Till then there is hope. Did Vikram die? :( I hope he is alive up there Please don't give front row seat to the Isha Yoga guy or any one who feeds on gullibility, spreads misinformation, showcases utter disregard and disrespect towards science. Not because, I hate those kind of people; but because you're insulting hardworking people of ISRO and other people who have contributed to the mission.

IMO, front row seats should belong only to scientists and journalists who have dedicated their life towards progress of science. Motherfucker mujhse pehli try mein code compile nahi hota and these guys are landing shit on the motherfucking moon. I feel so stupid Did we lose contact or shit? We might  have some bad news, it looks like  lander should have sent confirmation by now. [This was the first moment which made me feel something has gone wrong.](https://i.imgur.com/iESr1nG.jpg) Semi final wali feeling Stop hitting him, he did the best he could, maybe next time better :( Not bad from kaka. Good thing to hear for the scientists. ""I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right, yet to fail nonetheless. It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same."" :( Orbiter is still fine. Let's hope for the best what exactly happened? is the rover landed but lost communication? or no status known of landing? just want to say, i am proud that we tried it and did it the best possible way. hope isro has better data now to do next landing with more precision. ""jeevan me utar chadhav ate rehte hai. Lekin ye chota achievement nahi hai. Aapne bahut kuch sikhaya hai hame. Himmat ke sath chale. Mai aapke sath hun. Wish you all the best""- PM to ISRO scientists Loud angry question by NDTV reporter Pallava Bagla about why chairman wasn’t here to announce this instead of a “junior” spokesperson. 

Some uncomfortable stares. 

“Data is being analyzed” 

:(

(More awkward than that lander failure) Why is the green line moving away from the red one I hope that is not the case but I think that the spacecraft has crashed. At ~12-13 mins the data stopped updating and the scientists starting getting concerned.

When looking at the numbers, the last update was that the craft had a horizontal descent velocity of ~48m/s at a bit under 400m height, which is nearly 170-200km/h and vertical descent velocity of 59m/s, which is around 240km/h. To put it in perspective, the craft was descending at a speed faster than most if not all trains running in this country. Reading Modi's last tweet, Seems like there is no revival and the Vikram Lander mission has failed...

More power to the scientists though,worked like crazy hard for everything! Last 1.2 km and bam...right in the feels man... Indian Parents will hate Neil uncle for his tips given to the students. I wonder what happened to Vikram after we lost contact, did it drift away from the Moon surface or crash land on it.. [https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20](https://twitter.com/fawadchaudhry/status/1170073327324545024?s=20)

  


He is s&t minister of Pakistan [removed] I have grown up with ISRO. I have seen more failed mission live than successful ones. ISRO really struggled post-1998 sanctions. It was a time when our workhorse PSLV also used to fail but I never saw such negativity back then. Of course, there were not much of social media back then and people were not so invested either. Only Door Darshan TV channel used to broadcast some snippets during launch. Hell, I used to find launch timings buried deep into newspapers. But ISRO always came through. They struggled through cryogenic engines and GSLV too but look how the tamed those naughty beasts. Rocket science is tricky and history teaches us that it can be perfected only by trial & error. Look at DRDO's missile programs, its rather high failure rates is an assurance that we are indeed doing our own R&D and not just C/P imported tech. Today we have a comprehensive missile program which, I can say proudly, is mostly indigenous. And we have ISRO to thank it for. Just this week, IAF placed unfaltering confidence on our own ""Akash Defense System"" over much sophisticated Israeli system, a true joyus occasion. ISRO will come through, have faith.

&#x200B;

The important thing is we must not get demoralized. We have to try again. Next decade is important and we might see a ""moon rush"" again after NASA's Artemis mission. To the infinity and beyond. 🚀 #ISRO [@ChrisG_NSF
If Vikram failed to land - which it looks like - REMEMBER the ORBITER is where 95% of the experiments are. The Orbiter is safely in Lunar orbit and performing its mission. This is not a total failure. Not at all. #Chandrayaan2 #India #MoonLanding #VikramLander](https://twitter.com/ChrisG_NSF/status/1170072433115762688?s=20) Finally some good news for us. I hope ISRO nails the landing. Shit. Modi's leaving. Itna to boards k results k lie tension nhi hui Their body language is saying it all. Feels bad man they have worked so hard. Ight imma head out ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.""

Mahatma Gandhi A bit unfortunate, but it's still something to take pride in. Not many countries can even attempt something like this. Hopefully we will learn from this and will successfully land the next one. It's official now. Lander communications was lost around 2.1 Kms above surface. Data being analysed. The last data was like .335 km altitude and 45 m/s velocity i believe when they lost signal. Thats a quite high velocity. Everyone can bask in success and offer congratulations , Its in times of adversities like these when we get to see who is truly supporting the Space Mission and who all are just bandwagoning for success. [Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity](https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics#note-57553), 

back to the lab again Happiest person right now is Akshay Kumar... He, now, doesn't only have a patriotic script but a patriotic emotional thrilling suspense script. The only bad thing about this is DD's broadcast. That shit is old af. Good guy Modi consolled Sivan before finally leaving. The greatest success with this mission was that how many people will now aspire to study STEM I'm a bit out of the loop here. Will we see live video of the landing streamed ? I didn't even know if that's possible but wasn't the moon landing seen live in 1969. Bruh why the fuck is Gaurav Kapoor hosting this on hotstsar 

This is funniest thing I've seen in a long time Not receiving data it seems What is going on right now? Seems like a chilled silence... Did it crash? Fuck this is nerve wrecking I don't wanna go Mr. Stark.... I think we still did good guys. May be we will do lot better next time. The orbiter will still collect the data. So that's good news. The faces say it all.  It's gone splat. </3

I always liked space explorations, I used to have one small step as a ringtone, this was my chance to witness 1969 :( I am so nervous. I have no idea what happened, but at the same time the faces on the screen tell me that I know what happened. Damn, everyone looking sad as fuck. F for respect and GG for the efforts. That kids from Bhutan looked so scared Oh plz this is the starting of memes #Statement Coming! Watching the opportunity time lapse video on the surface of Mars made me jealous, there could have been similar videos of the moon from C2.  So close, yet so far. 😭 [Everyone at ISRO rn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzvyKLUcAAxqg6?format=jpg&name=900x900) A kid is asking him about reservations and he fucked right out of there. Lol. Complete switch off karke switch on try kiya kya? Sonakshi Sinha knows it. 


/s Need the bollywood twist, come on Vikram! ISRO CHIEF: If he pats me on the back one more time.... Any of you feeling bad for working for corporate and not some organization like ISRO? omg, the commentator is about to go down on modi We're in the end game now Stuck in DRS?  Cmon, the suspense is killing me! i think they've told the PM that its failed A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to the computer What data Issa okay. Shit happens. Efforts, people. It would've been wierd if the PM had bolted without giving this pep talk Livestreams ended on all platforms.  
I'd say that's the confirmation I saw the last distance from the surface as 330 m. But the contact was lost at 2.1 km from the surface. So, how was it tracked till 330 m?

What am I missing here? Am not gonna lose Is there going to be a livestream on YouTube? What if instead of water Chandrayan 2 finds oil on Moon, and we see a Press Conference by Trump that they will bring democracy to the Moon. Chalo koi nhi. Boys played well Space is hard man...unknown shit, walking in dark, nobody to give hand, once lost, lost.... rare unscripted speech from modi Just try again. It took hundreds of billions for US to land person on moon. India spent only 150 million yet Modi looks visibly annoyed with the kids. Poor scientists look scared...

Fuck this shit man, The pressure of mission success and on top of that the pressure from Seniors and Politician for their PR...Fuck this! Can we absolutely not get political and shift the attention to the scientists? 

Bruh they were made excited for this shit and y'all busy commenting about how Modi needs to STFU. What else can he do at this moment to be really honest. I hate his politics, but respect to him for the speech and answers Guys, the orbiter is still there and will remain there for another year, meanwhile Pragyaan was supposed to be there for 2 weeks. This mission was not a complete failure like some people are making it to be. Hopefully our students will take this in a positive manner and strive to achieve more in science. Our country needs more scientists, doctors and engineers. Akshay Kumar probably crying as he can't make next film... [removed] It crashed because lander ne paao upar nahi kiye they I'm abuzz. It's almost 9 PM here and we're having a ""Moon landing party"" between roommates. Granted most of them are Irish who just want a reason to drink, but we're buzzed nonetheless.

What's better is that my whole extended family seems to be up, I've already talked to uncles and cousins, even got sharma ji ka beta'd from my mom. This is the time to stand with the scientists, not abandon them!!! /r/yesyesyesno? At least it will stay on the moon forever and was the first object to land on the south. Bhai 200-500 jyada lele...buss land kara do Did modi just took an unscripted question ? Modiji: In bachon ko hi ab se interview dunga Getting super scary. It’s was travelling around 200kmph 😰 If it lost contact at 40ms, did it go splat at 40ms into the ground or was the trajectory preprogrammed It's so fucking crazy seeing all this unfold live! Houston, we've a problem. A huge F for our boy Vikram :( ""Telemetry is lost and no RF received"" were some faint voices near the control panel. Looks like a crash. Fuck why does this seem so scripted. did they get the data back? Did anyone see the lander doing a flip right before landing (during fine braking phase) on those illustrations/visuals? Chalo bhaiyoo Friday night kaafi wild Rahi. Ab sojaate h First mudiji fucks off.
Then they cut the live isro feed.
Dafuq is going on? It looks bad guys .. Aaah man... Anybody has an idea that how much time goes into analysis of the said data? Aliens got to it Mera Vikram aayega people said there would be some announcement. Link? So when we will get first update from orbiter? AS ISRO REACHED FOR THE MOON, ITS SCIENTISTS FACE PAY CUTS

As the nation gets hyped with praise pouring in from all corners, ISRO scientists aren't quit happy with the recent decision of the govt to reduce salaries of about Rs10,000/month.

This is the absolute opposite of the 1996 decision that approved for double hikes in salaries. 

The appeal has been penned by the chairman of SEA (Space Engineers Association).

""The government order talks of the performance-related incentive scheme (PRIS), which it says should not affect the 1996 decision of the double increments for ISRO staffers, because PRIS does not affect the basic income of any government servant.""

Akshay kumar has a nice script for movie Can we stop showering attention on every move Modi makes and actually focus on the scientists ffs. Theres plenty of time to bash him,but this isnt one. Im legitimately feeling sad about this:( Here is the first line of the control module's code:

    /*-----Om Shri Ganeshaaya namah-----*/ Yo this looks fooking interesting - probably some kid who watched this these guys are no nonsense , If they knew 100% it has failed they would have announced it by now

There still might be a sliver of a chance Fingers crossed that we can emerge stronger from this and funding is not cut. If i am not wrong Nat Geo is actually airing a show in which the channel will telecast chanderyaan 2 landing on moon's surface and the show will probably be shown around 11pm, perhaps? [BGM for](https://youtu.be/m3zvVGJrTP8) those terrifying 15 minutes ready. SPACE & UNIVERSE ([YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZiJMW5AdHY)) seems to be the one stream showing live feedback, is it from the orbiter? Even official ISRO is not showing that stream.

Update-1 | 1:07 AM: None of the mission control screens, seems to show what SPACE & UNIVERSE is showing. It seems very suspicious, are they just showing some old pre-recorded lunar video?

Update-2 | 1:19 AM: Yep, what they were showing till now was old video from some lunar mission. They have now switched to mission control video like all other streams. Is that Internet Explorer lol? Matlab!!? Im so excited, fingers crossed. From their looks, feels like scientists needs a good sleep...all with the puffed & tired eyes...

Hope all goes well and they get one! Doesnt look good. Not receiving telemetry from Mauritius no signal coming in from mauritius station ...The longer it goes on the worse the chances of success Doesn't look good guys. massive klpd BC, fuck. We all jinxed it. Pls pls Fuck modi is going down # F [So close...](https://i.imgur.com/IVYsgCI.png) Why it feels like this is a drama and soon they will celebrate... they r fuckimg with everyone... Mil gaya data Wait....Did someone mention SSR is receiving data?. Damn they cut the feed. Looks like a attempt only Bois :( why are the tables squiggly rather than straight? Genuine question +19 minutes since the link was lost. Listening to Man on the Moon in memory of our boi Vikram and lil bro Pragyan.. Heartbreaking. :(  I’m so sad Has this mission failed or there is still some hope?

Modi leaving is giving mixed signals. Unrelated,but why are so many of those kids wearing glasses Looks like failure in the late stage of the lander. We are gonna come back for sure but this is gonna hurt for a while... Word from ISRO, in next 12 minutes...Wait! Joe ""Rahul ShivShankar"" Rogan Bhai 500 lele bas land karade Yeh PUBG wala hain kya! F This is like the climax of a movie scene fuckkk plssss Kaka bhaag gaya? While it's sad, at least it was not a manned mission. The only loss is material. Neil deGrasse Tyson on Times now...never thought I'd say that Good job lads Remember that state of unity costed three times more than Chandra yaan 2 Why has everyone in this thread given up? Vikram is automated and loss of signal doesn't mean that it crashed. Go to sleep guys.. There probably won't be any big updates till the morning

They'll corroborate and confirm the landing malfunction in a few more hours I can already see the Akshay Kumar starring biopic. MISSION SUCCESS: 95% (So far)

Orbiter is the main mission. Lander and rover is like tech demonstration and a milestone that we landed on the surface. 

Hope we wake up in the morning with good news. 


Crash Landing is landing too. 100% ^\^s Ground Control to Major Tom  
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you....  
  
  
....Here am I floating 'round my tin can  
Far above the moon  
Planet Earth is blue  
And there's nothing I can do.. One small step for Vikram. One giant leap for 1.3 billion. Let's go. Amit bhai kuch karo.. halat tight h It reached till 400 meters...Seems like it lost the projected path there after and hit ground on uneven level... 

Hope, the rover is still okay and does its work! But first communication with lander is must...

Oh you 4 crore Gods, wake up...Wake up! Modi said bye... Mission failed we'll get em next time Can anyone sum up what's happened? Really lost here. RIP YouTube Stream as soon as Modi left PM to address nation at 8am from ISRO control centre Rahul Shivshankar on Times Now World looks out of his depth lol.
Edit : Misspelt his name. Why do they have hindi and english in the same stream, i dont like to hear the same thing 2 times , are there english only streams anywhere? The descent phase begins ....Almost like watching a thriller. Good luck guys... Will we get to see the real live stream from the satellite? History in the making. I like how everyone is in formals but this one dude comes in a jacket Man that people at ISRO are excited as kids. Their so much hard work is finally paying off. Oh, fuck. what's happening ...fuck me Something is definately off rn. Patience, thoda patience Looks bad guys. The orbiter will still be running so at least there's that Did we lost the communication with the probe? F Bhai panga ho gya ITS RECIEVING DTAA!?!?!? Hang in there, mates. the ""RF to orbiter"" is for the orbiter not Vikram Arrey koi confirm karo. RF! Bhai, Terror wala phase khatam hi nhi ho rha Hopefully the orbiter can carry on with its experiments even if Vikram has issues feed re-started !! Live stream announcement just now said only that the vehicle was observed until a certain altitude then communications were lost. 

They have not specified loss of the landing vehicle, but it is implied.  

This is sad. Peetega kya saley Ya looks like a crash... Modi giving pick up speech. Damn... Man i feel so sad.... When is the next moon mission?

November? is this a first major failure? It is taking so long because IBM is doing the RCA. Was landing automatic or manual? Did the lander take commands from here at each step of the way or the process was completely handled by itself with all the commands on it already? ﻿ Yo introvertedguy whatever...

Can you go 5 secs without making some cringy reference... Nobody wants to see it Well, ISRO does have the balls to livestream it though I'm watching India Today Live and they are doing everything they can to not admit that the lander crashed. They keep saying the landing is ""delayed"" and reiterating praise for Modi for not shitting on the scientists, as if that's a high bar. Rocket science is fucking hard, they shouldn't be ashamed to admit that this is a setback. [deleted] I think the PM left. We all know what that means boys. Modi: Ight imma head out! Experts at Home: ""Solar battery phook gayi"" 😂 [removed] Remember to play this as it lands

People who grew up in the 80's will understand scenes if the computer bluescreens Need more practice playing Kerbal Space Program it seems I need a cigarette Data is being analysed!! Modi is leaving. that's it boys. Can we see our scientists, please?
They matter the most, here! Loads and loads of mud sledging will happen...But just remwber your every word and criticism will be directed towards those hardworking Scientists!

If had it been Success it would be shared among all, but when its failure it will be of scientists. That's just how it is.

So just be careful. :( LOL, just watched the PM dodge a question on reservation. [removed] Neil Tyson ne Times Now ki TRP bada di Idk why but i am feeling so sad right now and i can't control it! Hope i will get to hear good news on the morning. ✌ So is it confirmed dead? Well guess no new movie from Akshay Kumar. Yo idiots ...You'll have plenty of opportunities to shit on Modi and the gov later

Some unity and compassion  right now wouldn't go amiss Most of the scientists looks like my neighborhood kulcha uncles and aunties Whatever the agenda maybe, but kudos to kaka for being there and talking to all the people and asking them to be courageous. Fuck, it looks like it crashed Wait Modi leaving? Why?? This is just like Dhoni waiting till the end saying not yet, to hit those 14 runs in last over...

Fingers crossed! All is well... If Vikram has crashed, how will we know it? at least we tried Seems like a crash boys.
Martians got the landing craft. The raeson for feed cut might also be partially that some passionate folks might have started crying.

Modi alos said ""Be courageous"". Yep it's over. That be courageous line confirmed it.


F. Lander landed on the moon, and the communication between lander and orbiter is back...We will need to check the whereabouts of lander from orbiter. 

Lastly, the rover can still be activated and made to do his walk...Let's hope for best! Wrong question at very wrong time girl. Good man Modi...First time since he became PM I am happy by his words for those Scientists...His words will lift their morals! Be courageous. Economy ka kuch dekho ""Be courageous"". Man this is one time when I didn't want to hear any pep talk :( Why did they cut feed?
Gimme my right to information Pondicherry ko wadakkam! [Neil deGrasse Tyson is live on Times now](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/live-tv) >This is Mission Control Centre. #VikramLander descent was as planned and normal performance was observed up to an altitude of 2.1 km. Subsequently, communication from Lander to the ground stations was lost. Data is being analyzed.
#[ISRO](https://twitter.com/isro/status/1170086810006900736?s=09) Regardless of the mission's outcome, can someone shed some light as to why we were focusing on moon instead of mars where there's a possibility of sustaining life? I get that no one has explored the dark side of the moon or whatever it is called but is it more important than Mars? We do have plans for Mars but I suppose if we focused more on that instead of moon then that mission will have a greater chance at success. About time people.. Why is this thread dead It's happening!! Ruh oh Something screwed up or what Signal's not being received God damn !! Has it landed ? Telemetry lost ??? 
Mission control center looking grim No celebrations so far is bad Only Madrid station is replying to the signal. It finished fine braking correct? Is everything alright? It seems something is not alright . God!!! Plssss. Damn my heart is racing, hoping for the best.... Worried. The mood is looking terrible, across the room Looks like its crashed. 😭 Yo Data pack recharged!! They have communication with the orbiter Did she just say, ... confirmed ?? Receiving data...was that a question or statement? They cut the feed!! Oh god! The uncertainity is getting unbearable :( why is the feed showing a still image? I'm so confused, what is going on? If it was a hard land or crash, what's the odds of Pragyan being OK? Data being analysed Hmm.. Stating the obvious. But what can he do. Can the orbiter or a satellite capture image of the landing site? Who is the astronaut on the hotstar stream? Hotstar stream is  slow compared to YouTube What happens to that spacecraft debris there? Cool This is why you don't need to turn this into a fucking promotional program, space is hard. First thing that crept into my mind was wow they must be so confident they are literally live telecasting the event. Still waiting and hoping that it's just some communication error >	Till date, only three countries - Russia, the US and China-have successfully soft-landed on Moon. Windows update ? Well, F's in the chat for all of us who are going to be late tomorrow to school, college, office , sigh Also F for Vikram RIP RIP RIP [deleted] They should hire an astrologer to use his divya drishti to see what happened [deleted] The livestreams ended when PM left. That's sad. Makes one think if it was all about his visit. 

A debriefing from a scientist before ending the stream could have helped. Why is Modi shown so prominently in a lunar landing event? How are the kids not posting stories smh, is this digital India? Now this is cringe. Please Stop. Guys can you updoot this thread to 200 What’s with grown men giving red roses to modiji? Scientist Aunty is announcing something .. lets hope for the best ,  but it doesn’t look good at all! oof ISRO stream cut It is still a proud moment for us guys. We will come back stronger.  :’) The best thing Modi can say is that we are going to try again. Chandrayaan 2 landed, just not the way it was supposed to [deleted] They're clapping a lot. That's good right? it crashed right? Shit! Come on. We need a win here after all that's happening looks like they exhausted their claps early. Who is going to give Modi the bad news? #F The police walked by the cameraman,and the camera cut off to another one. Hmmmmm /s must be a bad feeling  for the kids ... Kaka is back. [Mission failed we'll get em next time](https://youtu.be/Le9sLw2VdUg) I feel like he says the same things everywhere Has it crashed? Or no signal? Modi kaha gya? F ? Not to worry, Modi ji is now on the floor. [deleted] Maybe it landed and was attacked by the Israeli tardigrades? Watching it live on hotstar. It all seems so scripted. I do hope it is and they announce that the mission is a success like it happens in movie after almost failing in something. Modi is not ready for questions lol This hitting is getting annoying, Mr. Modi. Alright, Clap Clap Clap! Almost there! Vertical descent shortly Why is everyone tensed? What's happening?! Suspence guys...Suspence! 

Do no worry! All will be well... Boys played well, better luck next time. It would be great to be provided an update on if/when the orbiter can 'scan' the landing site and provide an assessment - assuming the onboard systems of the lander are knocked offline by the landing maneuvers... Looks like the orbiter is receiving data? Or was that a question? feed cut? Why couldn't that be live streamed, was that too much of a work or they just can't due to signal things? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvloHsmi_vg This duffer Modi spoils my mood. He wants to use everything for PR.

This should be only and only about ISRO scientists. Modi came to take credit... Leaves when landing fails.
But honestly respect to Modi for handling the response well, I think that pep talk was much needed for the scientists at ISRO.
May we reach greater heights! Now I am really worried about the manned space mission.  I'm blaming the inauspicious presence of Modi. Chanda mama so gaye suraj chachu jage....seems very relevent now!!! [deleted] ISRO chairman briefing kaka. Kaka must be saying *Amit ko call lagaun kya? kuch jugaad kar dega.* Nehru you son of a bitch you've done it again! Neil Armstrong was so damn lucky man! Agla wala Mars me bhejo, it should walk more than Opportunity rover. It likely failed, they just want to wait for the signal to confirm it. Social media is like its not a module . Kisika bachcha kho gaya ho lmao.

Maybe people should give two shits about issues that they actually can influence. Is Wikipedia down for you guys too? 

Likely not the cause, but it _may_ be us Indians looking up shit

Edit: it's up When modi came... felt like he was bit off.... thinking about something else..... there is shit about somrthing which makes him stressed oit.. Fuck i am getting panic attacks now . God plss .. let something move . I think it crashed, but, I am still very proud of ISRO. They have done amazing work in this mission too. NDTV ka kehna h ki bht tez takraya isliye Singal toot gya!. [deleted] Yes modi lol Yo Sathvik this is awesome. Glad that other countries explore space other than US, Russia and China 2.1 km, the distance between success and failure. Feel sad for the scientists who have worked hard for so many years. Also, Modi is such a bad omen. [deleted] Nehru is responsible for this. I guess all the praying and astrology really does not work

https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-opinion-was-isro-chief-right-in-offering-prayers-ahead-of-chandrayaan-2-launch/334944 WTF. Why does it look like a PR exercise with the PM now. We want to know the status in the control room. C’monn modi wtf that’s his speech !! Wtf
A person so well at giving speeches. Really those two words ???? Modi is so ready to fire off a tweet like :  The cost if this mission is less than the budget of Avengers Endgame [deleted] [deleted] Oh god here goes gobhi with his pseudo philosophical ramblings again Reminder that 'wAStAge oF PuBliC reSourCes in a CounTRy of pOverTy' is the same type of rhetoric used by sanghis to discredit PhD scholars like Kanhaiya, Shehla Rashid etc. Where did Modi go? Now... where it all begins? **Fake News** Ngl she's kinda cute doe

What's her @ I was up all night😩 nvm
Props to ISRO for attempting It got done oof'd There is no official announcement yet but agar it fails then Modi credits kaise lega saare. Now is the the time we put some money into some real research and development, we have to learn from these mistakes and improve ourselves. It’s a bit irritating to hear the mission was 95% success. For almost 30 years ISRO has been putting payloads into orbits, of  various kinds. 

This time what was different and unique was the payload had to descend and be soft-landed with baby hands.  And then the rover part , which was huge ( If the descent worked) . Both the new and unique parts of the mission didn’t succeed. So you could argue that the mission was a 20% success. 

I prefer to say that this shouldn’t be looked at a binary way. They’ve got to be learning from this experience.

What failed? - thrusters  or some other subsystem ?

Or what failed - the mission itself was strategically wrong - you were trying to land in an area where it was impossible to nail a proper landing ... or you wanted to be ‘1st rank/Guinness ‘ - that peculiar Indian need to be first in something ( first people to land in the hardest spot on the lunar surface)  And whatever happened to “walk before you run” - why not try an easy landing on an easy area. ( hindsight tells us even that’s not easy) I hope bhakts doesn't blame it on Nehru.

Edit : LMAO. Bhakts triggered ""Pragyan will not stray too far from the Vikram lander, given that its maximum range only extends over 500 metres.""

Bit of an anti climax or klpd this.. I have a strong feeling that they'd lie to us now \[**Unpopular opinion**\]

I'm very disappointed by the way ISRO, govt. is handling this failure, they should have come forward with actual data. Every amateur astronomer and enthusiast found that the lander was moving at a velocity in which it is not possible to descent safely, just by looking at the parameters on the mission screens, so why lie to your tax-payers which made this mission possible? 

A-least they didn't do a Balakot and lie to the world that the lander had landed and rover functioned as planned.

Failure was expected, it was a hard mission, kudos to the every person involved, but I have lost faith that any public organization in the country would provide factual data as long as this govt. is in power. Perhaps, future govt. will follow the suit as well, considering how well this strategy works to sway the public opinion. [deleted] [removed] PM Modi obviously hasn't left.

He's just praying to god jee 🙏🏻❤️😍

Whatta wonderful man [deleted] Modi and his speeches, sigh What if it crashes like the Indian economy? /s

Edit: Had to add the /s. Even I don’t want it to crash smh [deleted] Well the real question is whether the lander was tested in all scenarios with the right sort of stress tests, of course the intent here isn't to question the abilities of scientists but to understand why and hopefully futuristic missions learn from it . also there was an initial snag and then they deferred and then they again changed it in a short while. As general public we are obviously proud of frugality of isro but accountability can't be overlooked. It just blows my mind the Soviets did it in 1966. More than 50 years before. We are so far behind. Ab toh Modi phas gaya. Sab kuch live stream pe hai, koi surgical strike type exaggerate karke bol bhi nahi sakta. Is this lady telling or asking data received? So confusing. 10 minutes of lost communication and the entire bjp machinery went into panic mode.  
  
Kashmir has been without communication for a month now. [removed] Looking at the bright side, atleast Modi the braggart didnt get to take the credit for this big a mission..if this was successful, you're certain he'd have built his entire election agenda on roaming around the world boasting about his credentials taking credit for this..ironic for someone as anti-science as him Didn't Dr. Sivan perform puja for the success of the mission? What happened? Why did Modi give that speech ? Have we succeeded ??? Please somebody inform. The news is nonsense It performed oof Not a rocket scientist here but, shouldn't ISRO gone for something like parachute landing with protective bouncing covering like NASA did with Mars rover? Wonder what the logic was to land it with powered engines. I believe 2-3km is a doable height for parachute landings. My 2 cents.. [removed] [deleted] Probably lander ran out of battery, maybe just need to be recharge by solar light [deleted] [removed] FFS! I don't want modiji's lecture now 😡 Did they try turning it off then on again?  F F Technology in India is not there yet 932 crores  of tax payers money wasted . Thanks Isro Welp, a huge failure. [deleted] Well, now we can focus on issues in the country hopefully we're running out of ground water. [deleted] What a failure [deleted] Why the hell is it taking such a long time to land this damn thing? 

I mean it was launched some 40 days ago, wasn't it? PM in ""boys played well inshallah"" mode [removed]"
Science/Technology,India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology,15,7tahs2,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-must-shed-intellectual-colonialism-to-excel-in-science-and-technology/story-wfbhX71Evf9ilqqUKkjAQL.html,6,,s18m," Language is least of the issues with science and technology in India. The entire education system is based on the Sharma ji ka beta ko 90% mila tereko 89.9999 kyun mila ? system. The rat race is for marks and not for imparting basic education irrespective of the language.  LOL, fuckers really like tampering with education. How about saying to no to learning *vaimanika shastra* and *gomutra yagnas* etc?

Science isn't intellectual colonialism.By teaching it in Enlish, you are just ensuring that children are able to hook up on research at a global scale directly rather than be mediated by translators. 

Also, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.

 How about NO.  
We need English and it needs to be promoted further.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one’s native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today’s world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one’s native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

I know & respect Dr Vijayaraghavan immensely, but this is just bollocks.

What little we do has been captured in most institutes by entrenched interests. Let's fix all that and then talk about language.

I'm saying that as a supporter for having the first few years of primary education in the mother tongue."

Science/Technology,Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,141,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,,sjain75," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all."
Science/Technology,Need some career guidance (CS/IT),11,e2wq78,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e2wq78/need_some_career_guidance_csit/,7,"Hi,

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",silver3forlife," Do invest your time in courses outside campus.
They surely boost your chances for better package You cannot do just one. You need to know both technologies and have problem solving ability. PSA builds by more practice, whereas knowledge of a framework comes with a little less. 

You have to choose b/w full stack dev, data analyst, and other options. Stick to one path,  learn the tech (take a month or less and learn it through a project that you can upload on GitHub), and then start practicing from hackerearth, etc. Don't try to become the best programmer, instead try to crack the interview. Go through geeksforgeeks and in maybe 2 months have an understanding of the algos and types of questions asked. Then start applying."

I just put my fingerprint in, held my phone next to the machine and it read the card. All I had to do was insert the pin and I was done. Waiter didn't react much, probably because he was tired.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers. 

Meanwhile ours is rapidly a dumping ground of the dregs of the human gene pool. The intelligent procreate less, or emigrate, therefore they will be evolved out of the gene pool.

Basically we're fucked whoever we vote for. So, get yours, or kill everyone in your way. Chances are, you're killing someone stupid. [deleted]"

After 10th, I choose commerce due to peer pressure and not thinking about it. I would have done SCIENCE and pursued computer engineering.
I am been fascinated by computers and games since I was a kid.
I have 3 years into LLB and I wish to teach myself
1. programming
2. Hacking
3. Making 2D games or android games
4. Making apps
5. Making websites


I want to work from home, even possible be a bug bounty hunter or white hat hacker or work of police cyber cell department.


I am serious in this and will dedicate upwards of 6 hours everyday for 3 years.
Is self learning possible, so th I can do something great in field of technology??",7daystogo," Yes. Self taught programmers are a plenty. Practice makes perfect. 

Also Patent Attorneys are a thing and can be a fulfilling career for many. Think about being cyber law expert Of course self learning is possible but please be realistic about the kind of time you can dedicate to it. You're a full time student on top of that do you genuinely think you can add 6 hours of work in a day, everyday?     

Be more clear about what you want to learn, broad terms like 'programming' and 'hacking' mean nothing and everything else you have listed is a subset of programming. Not that it is wrong to start from 0, but researching what you want to learn at this stage will benefit you a lot.    
  
List out very clearly what you need to do, make a schedule of what you need to do when and weekly track your progress and tweak your program accordingly. The most difficult thing about self learning is getting the discipline to do it and for it to be lasting experience you need to be realistic about the number of hours you can give without burning out.   
  
You can make a great career for yourself in 3 years even if you are starting from 0.  OSSU is a great list of curated courses, you don't have enough time to do all of them but you do have enough time to learn whatever aligns with your career goals. Also restricting yourself to just MOOCs is quite fruitless, make projects, try contributing to open source projects (since you are a registered student you are eligible for GSOC please look into that), and get relevant internships in startups(since the bigger companies will shy away from you at this point).

It is A Discord programming community that welcomes people of all skillsets

We share cool learning resources, solve challenges and do fun :D Just go for it, most of the computer geniuses are college dropouts anyway 1) Easy to call yourself programmer

2) Pick a language, ideally C++, spend a year or two at it, move to Assembly language, learn writing assembly go to reverse engineering then learn package injection, hooks and sdk development to hack yourself

3) 2D games : Few months of experience will teach you to code games in epic. Unity is pretty easy

4) Making website is easy but again to be reallygood at it you will have to learn java, packet handling server side fetching and a lot of stuffs... which you will learn as you progress but sole focus is not worth unless you want to be Web developer. Trust me self thought programmers are all around our country. A lot of them even shit over the ""professionally/academically certified"" ones. Sorry if it offends anyone.

Honestly I feel if you can embrace the concept of approaching and solving problems and understand how to convert it into code syntactically (heck: even a pseudo code or an understanding as to how it may be executed), you are a programmer. Just embrace the concepts, keep your code simple, try to work towards improving code efficiently and don't jump around a lot on everything that glitters. If you start a concept, finish it or atleast have a good understanding before jumping to the next one. Have lots of hands on experience and be patient and steady while proceeding rather than reactive and erratic. Wish you all the best for your venture.

But I don't enjoy my job and I dread to go to office on Mondays. I'm no technology enthusiast and have no ""love"" for programming/developing/whatever else to do with tech.

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc) 

So, please guys, I'm really serious and I feel like I'm risking it all. So, please restrain from sarcasm and mockery.",justoneadvice," If you're sure about point 3,
Then try UPSC or SSC exams
i.e. IAS IPS or CDS Points number three and five are the most interesting. My advice would be to look into the fields of journalism and the social sector/NGOs et cetera. The most important thing is networking with the people working or planning to work in this field. The easiest way to do that is to get a degree in this field. So, look into Asian College of Journalism, Symbiosis, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and JNU. Also, familiarise yourself with the top names in this field, both organisations and individuals. So, for example, if you want to work on the environment there is Centre for Science and Environment and Sunita Narain. If you want to do something in politics, there's Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Abhiyan. If you want to work on rural issues there's P Sainath and People's Archive of Rural India. There's also the Teach for India Fellowship which pays around 20K a month I believe and the deadline to submit applications for this year may still be open. If you get it, then you can build connections in this field without necessarily studying for a degree. Become a govt librarian. Maybe? > Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month. 

For how long? Some of the options would pay you 10k for the rest of your life. How about being a history teacher? The main problem I see is that 3 can't be substantiated by 2 or 1. If you feel like switching to arts background go ahead,   don't mind what others say. There are tons of good courses available especially in DU and all where people are desperately trying to get into. Arts may be not holding the stature as engineering in our country but these are the areas in which we need more experts which one day you might just become. TC? YOE? What about doing an MBA and switching to product management? Look at a law degree of money is not an issue"
Science/Technology,Why is engineering so promoted across India?

It's not like a very good career choice

I'm a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now, but wtf is people's obsession is with this field? It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate, 9 hours in front of computer, and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep.
Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit 
I just don't get it, the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children? And how can they be proud of this? Like what are you proud of, that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?",ThrowaWayIdkIffy," It might not be what interests you but all things included, it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation. In most jobs (engineering or otherwise), you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you don't even come close to earning what a software engineer earns. It is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college. You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

The only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis. In the first, you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24/7. Also, you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail. The second option of freelancer is a very unstable one.

Indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match, in both of which Software engineering takes a prime spot (unless you have an MBA of course) Hey one doubt... I became project manager but did not get the 50-60lpa.. kahan complaint karoon? I hear what you are saying. I work around technology, and the completely temporary nature of the skills, and how often you have to start all over and learn all-new skills and technology makes me really stressed. 

I want my kids to understand a bit about tech, but I don’t know that I want them to do it as a career. Assuming OP is right (and he's fucking not) Professions where earning more than 50-60 lpa is possible after 8-10 years are:

1. CA
2. Politician (not sure legally though)
3. Own business
4. Actor (at least TV show lead)
5. Doctor
6. Cricket

There maybe more, but let's look at these first. Now compare the contacts, influence, money, luck and most importantly, time required to do moderately well in any of these fields, as compared to engineering.

Hence confirmed, OP trying to be edgy. >It's not a field where you are earning a lot, 

Wrong. maybe you're not earning enough. Your compensation depends on your negotiation skills and your technical skills.

>you are not your own boss 

In which job you are your boss when you're fresher?

>your not job is respectful, 

Wrong. Maybe your job is not respectful, don't project your own on others

> after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa

I don't know if people earn this much if they become PM

> you may earn 50-60 lpa but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, 

Wrong, you've poor money management and investment skills.

> you're still blind by office timing

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Wrong. You work for shitty company.

> Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate.

Wrong. That's for every job if you don't know how to take care of yourself.

>9 hours in front of computer

Wrong. 

>3 hours in traffic. 

Wrong. Not every city is bangalore. even in bangalore not everyone spends 3 hours in traffic.
> wait for weekends to complete your sleep.

Wrong, poor time management skill on your part.


> Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, 

Wrong, fundamentals always remain the same.

>your career takes a hit I just don't get it

Yes, If you weren't good at fundamentals.


> the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children?

Maybe your parents did, not everyone's parents are same as yours


> And how can they be proud of this?

Ask your parents.

>that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?

don't sit in front of your computer for 9 hours then. And don't work like a slave. **have some self respect** So, what is a good career choice? I am an engineer too got my degree from one of the best engineering college in India...I have been working hard for last 5 years now I can buy Jio net pack without asking money from Family. This is how success looks like.. Fuck that. I wish I'd made an effort in school and landed up an engineer. The 'least-resistant' path to success. If you wanna hit certain milestones in life (financial), engineering is the quickest. Engineering has provided a better platform for us middle class folks to have a secure & settled life. Which is an aspiration for most of the middle class. Because we have no scope for apprenticeship education like plumbers/electricians. These professions are looked down upon. We Indians despise those who work with their hands ( blue collar jobs). As a result only two professional lines are open. Since engineering is a cheaper degree (  4 years =5 lacs as opposed to MBBS, 1 year = 15 lacs) most students opt for it. Lol. It's an excellent career option. But then, you need to be competent and competitive. One of the things in India is that there is a natural progression for your education. 

School --> Plus2 --> Engg./MBBS/Degree --> Masters (*if applicable*)

The number of students who try to think out of this, and the number of parents who allow their wards to think out of this is pretty few. There is also the factor of not many students getting a good mentor to get a different direction or at least get enough knowledge about the other options.

In terms of the work, as someone said below, almost every profession nowadays demands that you spend time in front of a computer. This is not applicable only if you are in the sales field, or a factory worker/supervisor or really unskilled labor. Anywhere, where you are in an educated position or even at the managerial level in a factory, you will necessarily end up spending a lot of time in front of the computer doing a lot of documentation and reporting work at least.

I think the essence is to get a job which interests and excites the mind, and in addition, try to get a good remuneration for the same, which can support yourself, your family and whoever is required along with. The demonization of Engineering and Stem studies is incredible. Engineering is hard and good jobs in India are scarce. The main problem is, not everyone can be a good Engineer. Then when people are not capable of doing good Engineering, they despise it.

Does not mean Engineering jobs are bad. Perhaps you are in a bad company or in a bad job in a good company or both. If don't have have attitude or interest or both for engineering, quit right way and do a MBA. Mba jobs require more soft skills than hard skills, so you can bull shit away even if you are not interested. The fact that you think of becoming a project manager in 8 years just as you have started your career shows you have no interest in the fun part of Engineering. So I think it is much better you train for project management with a MBA. 

But if you think Engineering is fun or you have the aptitude for it, then sky is the limit. Immigration has been never so easier and there are also great companies in India depending on your interest. If you are looking for just money you are better of selling soaps and chocolates in a FCMG.

The typical IT companies even after their worst working conditions offer much better than other industries and a good possibility to immigrate or to find a great Indian company to help find a satisfying job. 

Please stop demotivating others with such rants Problem with 2 months of work ex : People with 8-10 years of work ex make 50-60 lakhs.

Unless 8 year work ex guys are coming to your office in BMWs/Audis, you’re in for another reality check soon. 50-60 lpm in 10 years...🙄 sure i will like to smoke whatever it is you are smoking 😬 Shitting on IT is the new fad amongst Millennials. Like shitting on Chetan Baghat. 

It is not a very good career choice? Wow. What else is? 

Like u/SerpantSociety told, most aspects of your questions is wrong. IT is hugely responsible for providing parity to the middle classes of semi-urban and rural India, and that is a fact. Earning 50-60 lpa whilst working a 9 hour day job sounds pretty awesome to someone who grew up in middle class mediocrity. I am sorry but our life experiences are pretty different from those with the privilege of being born in circumstances where ""money isn't important"". I need some help guys. I currently have 3 options to choose from which one should I go for? If I am doing Engineering from a Teir-1/2 College ? 

1- Mechanical Engineering 
2- Civil Engineering 
3- Computer Engineering 

I am not passionate about either of those but I will do anyone of them without any problem as I can work hard and get a degree easily. I just want a field which is safe for the future and guarantees a decent job with a decent salary. Which one should I prioritize first and the least? Any Advice is appreciated. This post is ignorance at its finest. Engineering is a key profession for building an economy, from top to bottom. When India was looking to modernize its infrastructure and economy, they need(ed) a lot more engineers to do it. They had 2 options, bring in engineers from outside, or train a bunch locally, which they chose to do. While India has seen improvements across the board in infrastructure and economic growth, they have trained more engineers than they need and now have a bit of a glut of engineers. With how supply and demand works, the average wage of those engineers has fallen.

The US is seeing something similar in health care. As the baby boomer generation dies off, the smaller number of Gen X's aren't filling up the hospitals and assisted living facilities that where built up for the boomers. Now those facilities are starting to close and we have a glut of doctors and nurses, so the wages for both are falling. 50-60lpa = some people earn that much in their entire career while doing much more strenuous physical labour.  
If you're earning that much you can in most places afford to live near your office drastically cutting down your commutation time.  
  
As for your health that depends on the individuals initiative and lifestyle.  
  
Whether you're earning 0 or crores, there's always a risk of you losing everything

  
As you said in 8-10 years you might earn 50-60lpa. If one is talented and ready to keep on learning forever there is no limit. Plus it is slightly easier to get into this field. the indian education system demands an ideal of 

(1) memory oriented teaching, studying, exam taking

(2) not *very* hard to learn, given a decent effort.

(3) no/little *actual skills*

(4) has **some** demand in the market, i.e., there is a greater chance of getting *some* kind of job with the degree than not.

(5) enables a wider variety of careers than most alternatives

(6) (minor) good for visas demanding 4 years undergrad education. (most BA/BSc etc courses are 3 years, which creates a problems for some visas)  which enables

(7) colleges can charge decent (not great) money for such courses, and the investment of setting up a college, acquiring accreditation etc is (a) reasonable (as compared to setting up a medical college say) and (b) has some kind of cash flow positive business model (though recently the glut of such colleges has killed this)

""Engineering"" (as taught in India) ticks all these boxes. And to be fair, given how the rest of the education system fares, engineering is a decent default for your typical unfocused +2  student to choose. It's an easy way to earn a decent salary. Furthermore, being a modestly successful engineer or programmer doesn't take a ton of innate talent. You might have something special if you get into a top-ranked program, but most people going into the profession are ordinary folks with a lot of pressure behind them.

There are other ways to succeed, but I think Indian parents steer their kids away from them because they're not stable, certain or surefire routes to success. The same dynamic exists in other parts of the world. Being a programmer is a better way of ensuring upwards socio-economic movement than being an anthropologist, historian or radio host. If you're from a poor background, you're probably less inclined to take risks when it comes to career choice versus passion. The same holds true if your parents come from a background, or can remember what living poor was like.

Most Indians are only recently middle-class. Even many upper-middle class people do not come from old money and likely had parents who struggled financially while raising them. So in a place as obsessed with status as India, the trend is to go after ""secure"" money in a way that preserves social standing. There is a cultural and socio-economic component mixed together. 

I know a lot of Eastern-European migrants in the United States. For them, money and status are interchangeable. So you see a lot of Russian and Tatar guys who brag about how they have basically no education but earn as much as doctors with trucking businesses and taxi companies. A lot of them are pretty miserable, though, because they only live to make money. 

Indians do the same shit, except don't see all income as equal (e.g., guy who drives a truck in the U.S. and earns 1 crore per year will be looked upon with disdain versus some programmer who makes 1.5 lpm). But Indians have that same we-were-recently-poor outlook that makes them scoff at any pursuit which isn't money-centric as worthless, even if it is fulfilling, based in passion and genuinely contributes to the well-being of the country and community. 

I know many people who studied subjects like history, sociology and and anthropology. They were all very smart people who got into good PhD programs overseas and are now earning more than the average engineer in India ever will. But that path is riskier, because an above-average sociology student still has a below-average chance of getting into a top-ranked program. Furthermore, people who go that route are basically required to get a doctorate if they ever want any shot of earning a sustainable salary. In a country where getting a job right off campus is a challenge, engineering is offering that. I am not saying that ALL engineers get placed. But its easier to get placed as an average engineer than as a  average XYZ stream person.

> It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa.

Engineers start out at 3lpa for jobs that can be automated. And they grow at a rate of 5-15% every year. For a basic skillset that is the right amount. Most of the jobs in the other fields also start out like this.

First of all, you don't make 50-60lpa in 8 years unless you started out at 25-30lpa, but if THAT is less for you, I wonder which world you're living in and what profession you imagine will pay more than this to a mass of people. Don't tell me startup or business, because they require a lot of fund to start and they're very risky. Very few startups and businesses make good money.

> but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

This holds good for most of the other fields. And you can do software engineering and get into freelancing which will give you this option. Not the case with many other fields.

> 9 hours in front of computer

That's on you. If you feel its too much, switch. Not all jobs are like this. A lot of jobs give you work from home options and flexible hours. More now than ever with the startup culture kicking in. You're expected to finish certain tasks and nobody is bothering you until the deadline. In newer companies, you're even allowed to pick what tasks you want to do from a ToDo board, set your own deadlines and work. If that's not freedom for you, idk what is.

> if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit

Literally same for every profession. If you're a CA who doesn't learn how to comply with GST, your career takes a hit. If you're a teacher who doesn't learn how to teach today's syllabus, your career takes a hit. If you're an agriculturist who doesn't employ modern methods, your career takes a hit!

But to be honest, what you read on hackernews and shit where they say technology X is dead and all is to be taken with a pinch of salt. The industry still has requirements for PHP who's funeral is performed every day by people all over the Internet. So, if someone learnt PHP in 2000s and decided not to learn anything else, doesn't mean they're jobless today. And 15-18 years is enough time for you to progress into management. So, this is also not a very valid reason. Simply because even if you are the 40th or 400th best engineer around, you would still get paid. If you are the 40th as a business in your industry, you will end up dead.

It is quite practical and that is why most Indian parents push this on their children. “In India, people decide what to do in life after they complete their engineering”.

-- Unknown Behencho I'm now mad that I never knew about a job that would have gotten me 5 lakhs per month after 10 years. One reason I think is because it's flexible , you can do whatever you want with an engineering degree , but with other degrees your options become limited. Cum-again please To be frank, this does not seem like a bad option in India.  I know this is not a perfect life and maybe not what you wanted, but that""s life.  Not everyone can become a highly successful person in photography, acting, singing etc. At least with an IT Job, you have an option to pursue your passion and a relatively very less risky job, with ample opportunities in India.  It is actually one of the best options out there. It has been good career choice since 90s. Now it is on the decline but career trends take time to change. Got you . Pakoda bijness promotor ! 60lpa in 8-10 years that too in Average service IT companies like TCS, Wipro, Infosys etc is that even possible? When you start at 3.5lpa I doubt you will reach 60 in 10 years in an average Indian IT company. Hmm, too many people got butthurt from this post I guess. > 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, 

It may be due to lies/dreams like that... kind of like chasing achhe din. As soon as I get home I will make a write up about it.  
Basically every parents think engineering jobs are easy to get and this made the  study it. Later to just realise it's a shity one and the don't have the courage to face kids.  Kids whose time they wasted.  
If you are unlucky to be born in a family who doesn't know what a engineer does and have to do, then you are fucked.   
My parents still things a electric engineering repairs bulbs and fixes wires.  

I passed from a private engineering college and working under a  PWD contractor. My parents wanted me to study and get a government civil engineering job(lol) .  
 I earn just 20k per month.  Might sound low. Let me tell you the perks.    
Work site is just Rs 20 commute from home and I get around 100 per day for travel.  I leave my home at 10 am and get home around 4 pm.  
My work being managing field and bill work.  PWD Office is 5 min walking from home.  
I have zero to no expenditure. I would like to point out that while engineering jobs give good salary as per Indian standards, but on a global level, we have one of the lowest  salary for an engineering job.


The reason for this is that companies come to India in search of cheap employees. In my own experience I have been in projects where I worked with European engineers. We did the same job, but there was a big pay gap.


Now I get that other countries have high living standards and hence the pay gap is justified. But since the qualification and job is the same, it highlights what Indian engineers can earn by entrepreneurship or freelancing!



I have followed what I have written and have been job free for 2 years now.

edit: So I would suggest to seriously consider entrepreneurship after engineering. Mainly because professions are not redirected in india. Take example pf pharmacy, it is only here where you can get prescription drugs( not only narcs but also antibiotics) can be anywhere without any consequences. Also, if you do get to work on your dream, it is absolutely powerful. I love sci-fi and I am living it. I think it's one of the best profession (good mix of pay and work-life balance) if you are average student.

And I am sure about ""pay"" and ""work-life balance"". It's not Europe. You will be surprised how shitty working conditions tons of people have. Nothing else is as safe Where do project managers earn 50-60 lakhs. If you go by societal norms, you're a failure if you're not -

1. Engineer 
2. Doctor
3. Entrepreneur
4. Government Servant

Did i miss any? Regardless, fuck societal norms. why India so many Engineers even overseas but India infrastructure shit. poor country means more things need to built and implemented. so parents push kids to look at opportunities to build stuff. rich country you can be an english major and still make kick ass money. Why is this post tagged as travel? It's the Indian way. Doctors have such miserable workdays and compulsory deployment but it's still promoted I would want to be ""50-60 lakh not rich"" person over anything else."
Politics,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?",827,e1yy9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/,127,"After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",jasonj2232," As someone who doesn't follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened. I was so confused wtf was going on all this time Appreciate the effort in this post Hardly the greatest, but yes.

For once, Shah was *defeated*. At his own game no less. Whatever has happened has for the good.

1. Shivsena is no longer Hindutva party, it has entered into its third phase - 1st - May Marathi/Bhoomiputra, 2nd - Hindutva, 3rd - Cosmopolitan/Mumbaiyya with shades of sons of soil politics. Gives it a lot of space to maneuver.
2. NCP + Shivsena + Congress is going to be a formidable coalition. However, there might be issues when they fight the next election (but that is something way in the future)
3. BJP is on backfoot, but it has room to grow. It is no longer restricted by Shivsena in terms of seat sharing. But it will never get a majority of its own. Tough task ahead. Especially after string of losses in various states. It can think of venturing into new territories like Odisha/Bengal but those aren't a sure shot. It might even lose Jharkhand.
4. This also brings an end (somewhat) to ideological fights. There are only 2 left - BJP and anti-BJP.
5. *Ideology ka dhong band karna chahiye* every party craves power. That is their only ideology. Thanks for this detailed breakdown. As an NRI I can't really seem to trust mainstream news completely because almost every one of them has an agenda or are paid by politicians.  I would give you silver if I had the coins. Here is some fake silver 🥈🥈 People like Pawar, Devegowda, Lallu n the next level like BSY, Siddu, DKShi etc (sorry for quoting on KA names, but i am sure there are others too) are very well versed with how to play the game unlike the pseudo Chanakyas who only know the language of threat & temptation of money. Not always can one win by misusing power is what is being proven yet again here.  **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD** :

&#x200B;

People do not vote for parties though (ideally by design). They vote for individual representatives. Thats why I am against the party system. > After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.

I disagree with this. We do not know if BJP promised the CM post or no. Hence can't just decide SS is the one to blame for their alliance falling apart. Though of course that has become or been made the popular narrative.

And this doesn't seem like SP pulling a fast one on the BJP but the BJP committing suicide. 

They won the election.

When SS refused to play second fiddle all they had to do was play the victim card and claim the moral high ground. When the state went to re-election they would have the narrative in their favour.

What I think has happened is that Fadnavis tried to assert himself and bit off more than he could chew. He assured Delhi he would get the BJP a majority on its own. Which is why I think they probably did promise SS the CM seat on rotation basis so there would be no splitting of votes, intending to backstab them when they had won a simple majority on their own. They didn't and that made his position vulnerable. He has enemies within the state BJP, and doesn't get along with Nitin Gadkari. He had to do something*. Then this drama played out. Whether he tried to poach NCP MLAs or Pawar played him, this whole thing happened because of BJP's and Fadnavis' arrogance. 

*Fadnavis owes his position to Shah-Modi. The duo needed him to stay in power so they could influence the state which has traditionally not had good relations with outsiders and Gujaratis in particular due to the splitting of Bombay state and he needed them to remain in power against Gadkari's faction.

Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM.


lmao 
#WHAAT The game has just begun! The same happened in Karnataka, but look who is in power now. It's a battle for survival for Shiv Sena, and Pawar helped. It isn't going to mean anything more to NCP than having a share in the power of this government. But for Shiv Sena, this means everything. 

Balasaheb was the man. Hypothetically, if he comes back & demands that Sena workers bring him the heads of every Sena MLA right now, their party cadres would do this in 20 minutes. Not going into the character & ideology of Balasaheb ( good, bad, ugly) but this was his pull. Even BJP knew they can't mess with him. They accepted being the lesser power out of two. 

After Balasaheb, BJP realized they could be bigger partner. And, Sena saw the ground slipping. They only have Maharashtra, BJP has the whole country. If they let them become the senior partner, why would Sena survive 10 years from now. 

In battle of survival, you befriend the devils you hate. A bhakt told me that Fadnavis got into CM chair and the first thing he did was to clear some farmer relief fund. Turned out to be true.

But yeah, i still think that was a shit display by all parties. More entertaining than any HBO or Netflix series. > DEMOCRACY IS DEAD

I'm pretty sure Indian democracy exceeds the lives allotted to a cat every week, given the number of times it's been pronounced dead. It's fun to make strong, hyperbolic statements innit.

The mandate was for BJP + SS. The _+_ there didn't work out, so the govt. will now by lead by 3 parties with a combined 48% of the vote share.

Was that really the mandate? Sure, no.

Have all of them proven to be greedy pigs? Sure, yes.

Is it bad for MH? Will we see return of blatant low-level corruption, and knee-jerk cancellation of BJP's pet infra projects? Probably.

Will the effects of this political game play out in the next election? It'd be stupid to expect BJP to not revise their alliance arrangements wrt Shiv Sena.

Ultimately, do the coalition parties represent the largest share of the ~~coalition~~ mandate at 48% of the total votes? If I'm adding 16, 16, and 16 correctly, I'm gonna hazard a guess and say yes? These games don't matter. What matters is keeping the alliance together. This is the closest we have seen to a successful implementation of the fabled ""Mahagathbandan"". Making the Ghatbandan work in Maharashtra will go a long way to proving it's feasibility for the voters. These three parties need to keep that in mind, play the long game, and focus on delivering results for the people. Will solve a lot of their problems, all at once. Well written post.

This is no victory, but a remarkable resistance of ruthless power.

I think that this scenario is similar to what we saw in Karnataka. Fractured mandate, BJP biased governor hurriedly installs a BJP CM. Opponents unite, run the government for few years, BJP uses central investigation agencies to go after corrupt opponents, government falls, MLAs migrate to BJP out of fear or opportunity, BJP comes back to power.

Unless AAP becomes strong, there is no stopping BJP in the long run. This is truly scary & worse scenario.. Pawar has dealt the death blow to Modi-Shah combine. Their air of invincibility has been broken. Modi is not gonna take this loss kindly. The anti-Shah voices in BJP and RSS are gonna be fanned. Shah is vulnerable and the vultures are circling overhead. >all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.

This one is not correct though. ACB has released a statement saying that some open enquiries have been closed against Ajit Pawar, and none of them have anything to do with the Irrigation scam. He has around 40 cases against him apparently. 

Appreciate the effort to articulate the saga entirely, though. Great job. Excellent summary. Thank you !! >DEMOCRACY IS DEAD

Hold on to these grandiloquent pronouncements.  Shiv Sena and BJP are living off the Hindutva votebank and they appeal to the same class of voters. If both of them were to contest elections separately, the hindutva votebank will split and none of them will win. So, their alliance was a convenience to let both parties remain relevant. Dishonouring pre-poll alliance is not against the constitution, so, technically democracy is not dead, yet. What Pawar did...

1)First gets Shiv Sena to stick to 50-50 formula until alliance collapses

2) Then he gets Shiv Sena to quit NDA

3) Then he gets BJP to drop cases against Ajit Pawar

4) Then he forces Ajit to quit & Fadnavis to quit twice within 2 weeks


Pawar ensured that.

A ) BJP have egg on their face.

B ) Get accused of subverting democratic norms.

C ) Besmirched reputations of the highest constitutional offices. 

It is indeed greatest game ever played. Pawar should open a school where politics/chanakya Niti is taught > Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of.

I don't agree with this. The BJP-Sena alliance was rocky since 2014. There was a tacit understanding during Balasahebs time that BJP would always play second fiddle to Sena in Maharashtra.

In 2014 that got reversed. They only went along with BJP because in 2014 BJP had ~120 seats and could cobble a coalition with smaller parties like RPI, Raju Shetty's party etc. etc. Sena had even asked their Central minister to resign (they had some Steel portfolio).

This was a fight of survival for Sena. They got their moment and struck at the right time. Pawar might have helped, but this was mostly Uddhavs doing. Awfully looks like the public's choice was one out of:  
1. BJP wins, The other parties keep their integrity, The public loses big time, BJP reigns supreme.  
2. BJP loses, The other parties give away their integrity, The public loses a little less, BJP invulnerability breaks.  


Given how fucked up leveraging justice as a political tool is (BJP used the accusations against Ajit Pawar as leverage), it seems option 2 is better in the long run. One thing is certain, I'm never going to vote in any Indian election after this! Why bother when your cast vote is ultimately traded by power brokers like this? A part of me still says that even though they lost the government for now, they will one by one pick pieces apart from the alliances. Well yeah, Governors should be neutral by law. Why the fuck is that not the case?

Also, President should be neutral by law, but here we have yet another puppet in the hands of the BJP. Ideology has never mattered. They'd sell their own mothers if that meant they'd get power. How long before the new alliance-trio will collapse? 🤔 Great post and very well summarised!

You should also mention how the Governor imposed President's Rule before the time given to NCP to prove a majority had elapsed, which is another example of how the BJP manipulated neutral institutions for its benefit. Hold your horses though. Picture baaki hai. #EKACH SAHEB, PAWAR SAHEB Amazing analysis, but I don't think using the game of chess as an analogy is appropriate. You can't really cheat in a game of chess. You can't switch pieces when no one is looking, can't make one move and withdraw that move before the opponent plays his. And more importantly, chess is a game for people who use their brain power to play the game with honor and sportsmanship. These fuckers are crooks who won't know where to place a pawn on the board, let alone a king (I have some very good suggestions where they can shove the pieces and the board too, however).

These may be dark days for our democracy, but we are also seeing people sit up and take notice of these underhanded and late-night skulduggery employed by these people. If enough people take notice and decide to do something about it, things can change. And people such as yourself, analyzing and displaying facts for all to see, is the first step towards any sort of positive change. Sharad pawar basically didnt do a thing. Shiv sena is the one that betrayed a pre poll alliance. 


It will be destroyed in next elections, MMW The interesting question here is - Did Ajit Pawar resign first forcing Dev Fadnavis to resign, or did both of them resign simultaneously? All scripted . Thank You for your time and wonderful writing to put this into perspective. What does this mean for the growth of Mumbai ?

Are people expecting growth to be stalled ?
( specially of the metro projects ) This will play out like Karnataka. Just wait and watch. Can we all agree it was a sad month for democracy ? Why the fuck are those guys accepting Ajit pawar back. Why is there no cone or shame?
Dismiss the fucktard. I disagree that democracy is dead.

I rather think this new balance of power will keep it more alive. A good government doesn't run and do good things just because there is a strong ruling party with most votes but also because of a good and strong opposition. BJP is going to watch them like a hawk and they are going to be so much more worried about being corrupt or even appearing corrupt.

These might be old people returning to the game but the game has changed a lot since they played it last. Sorry OP. Democracy is not dead. It is probably taking a nap or is distracted. Once it wakes up, it will stab Shah-Modi in the ass till it bleeds. This combination of  shiv Sena, NCP and Congress was meant for keeping away BJP from the power, though BJP made all its efforts to negate it. But BJP not only failed in its endeavors but also exposed itself . Whole Nation has watched the drama, finally took a deep breath after the decision of apex court.  This episode has paved way for the nation that any party can be kept away for its foul play if there is will. Next big loss for Shah and Modi is coming from TMC in 2021.

I can bet money on this because no one in the state wants Dilip Ghosh as CM, even if they support Modi and BJP [which is why they won so many seats in WB Lok Sabha. People like Modi, not state BJP leaders.]. 

I sense a TMC Govt with outside congress support. And in 8-15 months, BJP will do another Karnataka again? I'm trying to figure what kind of government can I call this Indian government? 

Fascist? Oligarchy? Totalitarian? (not the extremes ofc) I guess it's the combination of all three. No? Would you mind summarising things that happen in India for people like me who are confused half the time and irritated the other half. . Like a weekly blog? :) King Pin Pawar got his nephew out and got back in the house. This was pretty intense , speaking from non political standpoint I have few points to add.

* Posted it in other thread too..Due to this SS+NCP+INC arrangement, INC has managed to break away a perception of being Anti Hindu!  This is a big win for them as there seems to be a major propaganda about them being Anti Hindu.  So all that RAGA's temple hopping and Janeu wearing could not achieve will be achieved by this one move.  This can be a big threat to BJP in future
* INC and NCP just avoided losing relevance.  If they had not formed the Govt, central Govt would have used its machinery to break them away thereby causing INC/NCP more damage.
* Sharad Pawar could have easily joined NDA at the center and got a plum ministry for his daughter and Ajit. But he has decided to leave a legacy for his daughter and I have a feeling that she may play a more active role in MH politics going forward. 
* BJP will have no choice but to launch some true reforms like reduction in personal income tax as they would compete to keep the their popularity up. I think we should wait atleast a year to confirm it. Fucking ninja Thanks a ton OP! This was a good summary and probably you can give continuation posts or do this weekly/monthly for us redditors who want facts and unbiased opinions"

Check any statement he has ever made if you don't believe me. lolva Then GTFO, asshat. Jhoot bolo, zor se bolo, baar baar jhoot bolo.
-Modi Zee Never had desire to enter politics... But koi muslims ko mar hi nahi raha tha, so I had to do it myself. So proved that Entire Political Science is fake. Never had desire to enter politics but  wanted to fuck it up."
Politics,Shashi Tharoor Has One Word to Describe Maharashtra Politics: Snollygoster,82,e0f60k,https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/shashi-tharoor-has-one-word-to-describe-maharashtra-politics-snollygoster-2397437.html,30,,ShabbitRabbit," He simply tweeted. That's fine. This being peddled as news, however, is the actual cringe. Shashi's sesquipedalianism is reaching vertiginous elevations. You keep on using fancy words. They will keep on forming governments. Which means, “I don’t understand”. Looks like a Pokemon's name Sorry, not even I know that one. Omg Sashi you charmer. Didn't he use this word in that Quint quiz? GRE people: write that shit down Hon. H. W. J. Ham, a member of the Georgia Legislature the humorist of the last campaign is the author [of a new word] and the word is ""snollygoster."" This he constantly applied to a certain class of politicians in Georgia. When in Atlanta a few days since Mr. Ham was asked to assign a definite meaning of the word. He replied: ""A snollygoster is one with an unquenchable thirst for office with neither the power to get it nor the ability to fill it."" According to this definition Georgia does not have a monopoly of [sic] the snollygoster.
—West Virginia School Journal, February 1893

Our first written evidence for snollygoster is from 1846. By the 1850s, it was used with some regularity in the American South to refer derogatorily and somewhat humorously to a politician. Etymologists posit that it might derive from the word snallygaster, which is used to describe a mythical creature from rural Maryland that is half reptile and half bird, and which purportedly preys on chickens and children. But there's a snag: snallygaster shows up in print much later than snollygoster does.

Snollygoster began to fade into obscurity, but got a boost when Harry S. Truman used it in a 1952 speech in Parkersburg, West Virginia, first denouncing Republican ""snollygosters"" and then quipping ""I wish some of these snollygosters would read the New Testament and perform accordingly."" When asked by the press corps what snollygoster meant, he said it referred to ""a man born out of wedlock."" Not so, cried various reporters:

Former President Truman may have been making a talknophical assumnacy when he said that snollygoster is what Southerners call a man born out of wedlock. Experts of the Dixie dialect rushed to their dictionaries .... They reported that a snollygoster can mean a number of things, including tadpoles and politicians. But they didn't find Truman's definition in their research.
    —Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 12 November 1953 Erudite *BaJaPa Bhagya Vidhaata plays in the background* Snollygoster is just a fancy word for shrewd,unprincipled politician . Even when Congress is getting decimated in front of his eyes , he would rather lick the boots of Gandhi family and show off his vocabulary . its getting a bit old isn't it *Shashi Tharoor farts*

Note: This was an unplanned AMA, so it took some time for us to get the verification done. How do politicians earn money?


Like how can a salaried person get into politics? Can be a bit easy for people with business and family to support it, but what about others? And by politics i mean proper politics, not volunteer. Is AAP planning to expand? I believe that is the only way to curb air pollution for North. 

Also do you believe AAP needs more leaders upfront other than Kejriwal?

What are Key Reasons for failure in May elections? 

Do you believe announcing all your strategies openly makes AAP vulnerable to counter strategies from opponents?

Hope you expand and develop North. Cheers and Thanks. As an MLA how difficult is it for you guys to get in touch with ground realities

And I know. AAP MLAs are better in touch with their constituents, what do you think makes other party MLAs not get in touch with their people? You once led a march to Chief Ministers office over dengue deaths, if am not wrong. Do you feel Arvind Kejriwal is dictatorial?

Is there any kind of hierarchy in AAPs party structure or everyone is equal?

Any dark secrets about the system you learned after becoming a politician and an MLA? Thanks for this (and everything else you do)

1) How do you and the party keep working in the face of stiff, even criminal levels of harassment across party lines by the forces to be?

2) Will the lack of transparently sourced funds mean AAP will never find resources to grow beyond Delhi?

3) What are your challenges ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections? Thanks for doing this. I have a few questions.
1. According to you, what must we do as a society to stop the heinous crime that is rape from being so rampant in our country? What role do politicians play in all of this?
2. What are your views on the situation of news media in India? What can we do to improve it?
3. Where does AAP stand in the country’s political scenario? It doesn’t seem to be the ‘holier than thou’ political organisation that it initially was. If you could describe the party to a common citizen in a single sentence to convince them to vote for you, what would it be?
4. What are your views about the ‘atmosphere of fear’ as Rahul Bajaj phrased it? Does it exist? Does it not? What do we do about it?

Might be a bit long lol What is the biggest challenge in fighting mafias, and how successful have you been? What did you do to achieve it? With the recent mass legalization of cannabis across the world and a lot of it's benefits coming to light, what is your party's stance on its legalization for personal and/or industrial use?


 what is your opinion on the trans rights bill?


Does your party support legalization of gay marriage? How can we help you in the elections? Namashkar sir! 

1>The delhi govt promised to provide free WiFi access across delhi but it hasn't been the case on ground What has been the progress on that front? How many CCTVs out of the 1.5lakh promised by the Hon'ble CM  have been installed uptill now in Delhi?

2>The Delhi Govt's string of announcements in the past few months like making rides free for women,the grant on  electricity bills upto a certain unit consumption,filling exam fees of students may be extremely noble and good in principle but certainly put strain on the delhi govt's treasure. How does the delhi govt plan to compensate and manage the govt's funds for the amount of concessions it's providing/intends to provide? Sir, 

I live in Timarpur. 

Have you seen encroachment near Chowdhary Fateh Singh Chowk ( Timarpur Chowk) ? Earlier it was only a small fruit market . Nowadays they are selling momos , roasted non-veg items, chilli potatoes etc. as well on open road. Moreover we could see 2-3 food vans always present there adding to chaos. People are parking on the main road and the area is prone to accidents.

Similarly , in summer the Timarpur area also becomes stopover , boarding points for many volvo buses going to Himachal .

The unauthorised colony near CGHS clinic has totally encroached the strech from INMAS to CGHS clinic and we could see anti-social elements drinking and fighting. Many of the residents of this colony are battery rickshaw pullers and cab drivers who park their vehicles on main road.

On both of these roads ( Lucknow road and chowdhary fateh singh marg ) we have DTC bus numbers 256,212 ,108 running regularly . Driving on these area is a nightmare. One can not imagine walking on these streches.

Please pay attention to these area and free them from encroachments. I am not against people who are selling stuffs on pavements or living in jhuggi jhopdis , but , road safety is something which can not be overlooked. What are your thoughts on the JNU fee hike protests? Will AAP declare climate emergency anytime soon? 

What are your references when studying about the climate change issues?

2019 felt like India faced first volley of severe climate related issues (on a national scale) that scientists have been warning everyone about since a long time, what are the plans in Delhi? 

In your personal opinion, should India declare climate emergency? Hello Mr Pushkar, kudos to your party for your work in education, My questions are:

1. AAP view on LGBTQ community.
2. Dr Ajay Kumar former congressman joined your party before jamshedpur east election, why wasnt he given ticket to run from Jamshedpur east, he is a popular guy, could have challenged Saryu and Raghuvar Das.
3. AAP supported the kashmir issue in parliament, is the party ok with kashmir being bifurcated. What right does the party have for statehood, when you support state sponsored oppression on our own citizens.

Again thank you for taking the time to do this. Good evening Mr Pushkar 
I put this question to you on behalf of Type 1 Diabetic Community
We are running a small NGO to spread awareness for type 1 Diabetes in Delhi , we have close to 700 type 1 Diabetics with us 
We cannot survive without Insulin , we need Insulin to survive , most of the times we see that the Insulin that's available in government hospitals is not the one we need 
What is the solution that your government can come up with for us ? 
I know AAP government has done good work in the health Sector so far 

Regards
Harsh Kohli 
www.diya.org.in What do you think, why people of India chooses someone like Gambhir instead of Atishi who is a highly educated human being, someone who can affect the lives of millions of Indians in a positive way. So they do have eyes on reddit. A question from Pakistan, what will be your party’s stance on Pakistan? Will you continue current gov’s policy i.e. no talks whatsoever? Will you depoliticize cricket and play cricket with Pakistan? Dear sir, please let me know how I as an NRI can engage people to vote for AAP. Is phonebankimg available? Or my only option is to donate to AAP?

What do you think of the radical Hindutva fascism in Centre? How is AAP planning to counter it?

Many thanks sir. What are your  expansion plans to other states? There was quite a bit of discussion on eradicating manual scavenging. AAP has talked a lot about it. But action has been limited on that front. Why? Namaste MLA sahab.

1> What has been the progress on the jobs front? Have 8 lakh jobs been created as promised by the party in its manifesto in 2015? What measures can be taken the delhi govt to increase jobs for graduates? 

2> Aam Admi Party's origin in many ways traces back to the historic India against Corruption and Anna Hazare ji's fasts in the Ram Leela Maidan following which Mr.Kejriwal went hammer and tongs on the then Congress Govt. for their corruption and incompetence but cut to 2019 Lok Sabha elections AAP wanted to do a coalition with the same congress to stop the BJP. Has the Congress changed in the perception of Mr.Kejriwal or is the BJP even a bigger evil than the congress?

Edit:-Can such a probability arise again if AAP were to be in touching distance of majority post the election results? dang i missed this 


You should also approach Kejriwal to do an AMA sometime, what say u/pankajpushkar [deleted] Delhi is still one of the most densely populated cities in the world and not one party has mentioned population control as their agenda, are you or is AAP planning anything for population control ? Why is AAP in the mood of forming an alliance with the Congress? Are the congress members clean now? Just wanted to congratulate you for taking this step to reach out and that too via Reddit 💪 What's your opinion on the current pornography laws in this country? do you like green apples? Isn't AAP a Kejariwal Centric party? What's the future of AAP after Kejriwal? Why there is less popular leaders other than AK? How can AAP claim it's a new generation party if they follow Personal Glorification only? Hello sir,

This is more of a suggestion than question. We all know that the common people trust in police has degraded and for right reasons. This country badly needs police reforms. 
Its a request to AAP government to implement body cam for police (like in US). I know this is a long shot but everything small has to start from somewhere. No other party would do this. If it starts in Delhi, maybe it will catch attention to the rest of the country. I have thought this thoroughly and I believe this will have a butterfly effect in the long shot and will improve a lot of things that India is facing now.
Its my humble request to PLEASE consider this. This will really be very helpfull. Only you guys can do this

Thank you Why won't the Delhi government apply market based solutions for externalities such as pollution which are both effective and efficient at tackling the pollution problem than feel good theatrics?

Not that I expect government to apply or even consider market based solutions but here's the link-

https://www.livemint.com/opinion/columns/ronald-coase-has-a-solution-for-delhi-s-air-pollution-11573491626858.html Could you comment on the number of political leaders that have criminal records?
Do you think this is in part due to Indias hugely backed up judicial system?

How do you aim to tackle it? Thank you u/pankajpushkar for this AMA. I’m a med student right now in a college so my question is-

1. What do you think about the current conditions of doctors where they fear for their lives in government hospitals because of unfit security measures?

2. You might have heard of a case some days ago in Chirayu medical college where a high court judge and his son came and beat and disrespect a teacher (because the Judge’s son was being disruptive in class and was made to do sit ups after repeated warnings from the professor). Do you think such abuse of power by a judge is warranted and should he be punished? Wait, Indian MLAs are now doing AMAs on Reddit? What year is this? As a woman, i have to ask this imp but clichéd question. What is your party's stance on women safety measures. I know your party made bus transportation free for women, but what are some measures you guys are planning to make in future to make the area safe for women? 

Also, why do you think the rapes which are proven, take so much time to provide justice? Why is the justice system so slow in India? What are your or your party's views on it? Do you guys have any plans to come to West Bengal? I don't want another TMC government, and I certainly don't want the BJP to gain a foothold in the state. Thank you for hosting this session. I have a few questions: 

1. Delhi's pollution has been pretty bad since 2015 itself, so why was it not possible for you to use this year's odd even as an opportunity to present world class public transportation system to the people of Delhi as an alternative? 


2. What have you done to ensure the protection of cctv footages from schools as well as streets? Where are they stored and how are they protected?


3. I heard about an app with which you could snapshot the potholes on the roads and report it to the relevant authority.  But why is no one aware about it? Has it not been launched yet? How good are the on ground backend processes? 


4. Should higher education be costly or free of cost?

Thanks. 
AAP over the years has lost many good leaders over the years who helped it grow... is there a sense of loss in the party. How do I sign up to work with you. I have been following AAP since it was founded and always wanted to work for society. I am greatly impressed by your party. So again, How do I start? Why did you decide to become a politician? Greetings!

I want to know about the steps taken by your government to make public institutions more accessible for Persons With Disabilities, if any. How do you plan to promote politics to the youth when the massive corruption and failing system acts as a deterrent. Also, do you think the Indian society fails to be progressive in terms of mentality compared to the west? Construct  big air purifier towers in and around Delhi! 1. So many people have illegally extended their terraces in the Saket area. 

2. A lot of students who come for preparation in Delhi have been cheated many times by the homeowners in the name of a refundable home security fee. Just check Google Map reviews of the hostels and you will know. Some say even police are involved because they are not afraid of police cases against them. If the AAP government can do something about the students who come from outside to study in Delhi...something like well-maintained Government hostels in coaching areas it would be great. Any plans for extending your party in the Eastern region? The Northeast may be a good spot to hit. So, here we have an actual bro. A politician on reddit. 

My question, do you have another reddit account which you use anonymously to lurk and participate on reddit? Just yes or no, we don't want the name of the account. As a Southie myself,why isn't the allies with the left going as strong as one wants.
We want a strong coalition to put our expectations on ✊ Only question to you and kejriwal.
Not from Delhi but have friends and relatives over there.
My experience is good about your govt works.
My question is do you want to plan out side delhi?
I am from Gujarat. Son of farmer. Sir.. i have lot more to share but i am mentioning only lil bit.
Electricity bill is impressing me all the time.
Sir... Gujarat is producing huge electricity gujarat sell it outside gujarat.
But we are one of them who pay more than outside gujarat.
In some states electricity is free for farmers. Even we are paying huge.
RIP English Kejriwal wants full statehood for Delhi but he didn't have qualms against bifurcation of my state in to two and changing of status UTs which was done autocratically with president's signature, why? Don't say national security Thank you for your service, and for doing this AMA. 

I only have one question: how do you propose involving the youth of this country in its politics? At present it's very hard, if not downright impossible, for most people to become a part of the democratic machinery without getting their hands dirty. Anyone can contest elections, but actually fighting battles in large electoral grounds requires a lot of capital, which is out of reach for most people. How then must an aspiring political leader step into the field? What is your party's plan to make Delhi's air quality better? Hello, what are your thoughts on [farmer suicides?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers'_suicides_in_India) How is the Govt going to foot the bill for the women metro subsidy? 

I mean you have a limited budget, so the money going there has to be taken from something else's funding. I feel a big reason why corruption festers is lack of transparency. In the same vein, one reason I feel why voters aren't voting based on performance of the elected members of government is that it's not quantized in a manner which could be easily comprehended by the masses. 

If I have to know how the MLA of my constituency performed during his terms, beyond anecdotal experience of the constituency, I have to take the onus of gathering all the promises made and then gathering the status of progress from all sorts of random sources.

Do you have any ideas on improving the transparency and showcasing the progress on the election promises? Is clean air possible in this lifetime? What are you doing about affordable housing? Certain areas of Delhi are extremely filthy (palam dabri road for example) , when can we expect them to be clean? 1) How do you plan on increasing AAP's voter base in Mumbai?
2) Is your party membership increasing significantly or is it a cause for concern? What are your opinions on the disenfranchised youth in India? Why aren't they represented adequately?
Do you think it's a good idea for college students to join college-level parties that tend to get carried away with what some might consider 'petty politics', or do you think it's better for them to join political parties right from the get go? Why isn't AAP campaigning enough in some states?
I think it high time that you start going for the staus of national party. I believe there is a huge majority who would vote for AAP in Assam because of the mess that is BJP. This AMA is commendable. 
I have been following  your work in Delhi and its unprecedented.  Kudos. 
However, I personally  feel AAP lacks the teeth to chew into other parties on a National level. 
If you are going to wait for people to wake up and vote for you because  of your good policies ,its going  to be a long wait. 
I wish you good luck . You truly  need it Sir, I want to ask Why don't you declare Dr. Ajoy Kumar as AAP CM face from Jharkhand.
I am from Jharkhand and i would love to vote for him. hello sir I actually think that aam is way  better at understanding people I hope u win luv from delhi What is your take on the money in politics? Can we stop anonymous donations to political parties and campaigns? Can we abolish donations from corporations? Can we have a maximum limit for donations from any one person? I am 24, and I want to enter politics. I feel strongly for it after seeing the thinhs that are happening over the past few years. Where do I start? Is it a viable option? Hello sir first of all I want to thank you for doing this. Its a big surprise for sure.

AAP has done very amazing work in Delhi, I'm neither from delhi nor live but I think Kejriwal Ji is a good person in today's politics even though he made some bad comments in past but leave that aside. So I just want to ask about Kumar Visvas and other people who left you what really happened ? Is it about RS seat or something else ? Atleast you are here to answer thank you for that. I know that i may be asking question out of your radar.

Question 1: Which rule should be brought so that children and women can be safe?

NEXT QUESTION IS CRAZY.

Question 2: What if Hindus are taught the Gita , Muslim are taught the Quran , Christian are taught Bible and like wise other religion with their spiritual book in every school along with other subject up to higher secondary education? Hey! Appreciate the reddit outreach by you. Was this a part decision or are you here in your personal capacity and how far up can you go while answering these questions? Those are not my questions though.

Here they go

1. What exactly was the sticking issue between the state and central governments with regards to pollution? Ofc nobody wanted it to persist for how long it did, so why wasn't there a concensus building done by both ends?

2.  What does AAP plan to do to correct course with Delhi detoriating water quality? Or are we again looking at 'air pollution' scenario where we're waiting for it bottom out and then the blame game beginning?

3. What is AAPs position on joining hands with the Congress in the upcoming state elections? Does it view it as an ANTI-BJP vote asset or a dead weight liability?

Thanks and appreciate you doing this! For the next election, Sir what are your plans to counter the dirty tactics that BJP does to attract votes before election ? You don’t have to tell us if it is some secret plan. In that case just let us know that you have given this a thought and are ready to counter any dirty game that BJP politicians plan to play. 

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration to read this post. Good to see politicians using Reddit and letting people questions being asked to them. I really appreciate that and it really makes me feel comfortable that there's still hope in this country! Where many leaders don't even like questions asked these days, they are so arrogant!

I have a few questions:

How hard do you think it is, to be honest in politics?    
Why did you decide to get into it?  
Have you ever got threatened by corrupt people or mafia, if yes, how did you deal with it? Stop bullying in school As Immigrant students who are always at the mercy of landlord to throw them out a moment's (or Month's) notice. How do you think it can be solved amicably? Shouldn't the tenants also have equal power? Like maybe the landlord can't ask the tenant to leave the house for the first 6 months of the agreement at least.

Owners act as a dictator some times. As far as I'm aware once you rent the house. The owner has no business regulating what we can or cannot do in our house. Of course I'm not here trying to disturb the nighbours or damage the house. I mean what is this discrimination based on food habits, religion, etc ? Thank god I'm not from any minority religion. But the amount of discrimination and problems my friends face makes it impossible to find a house. What are your views about recent Maharashtra election situation ? Is is true that AAP really dosent have money to fight the delhi elections?...what's next you think? You have done some good work in schools but is it applicable for colleges under Delhi govt like IIITD ? In IIITD infra is added but any other changes made or not? Why do you think free transportation for woman on buses and metros are more important than making the city more secure and devoid of crime? Hey appreciate you doing this. 

From a common man's perspective, voting for BJP should be more beneficial because of increased center-state cooperation. For ex: Full statehood is something AAP can probably never get passed but if BJP was elected in the state they can get the center to agree. 

With this in mind I just have one question.

What do you think is AAP greatest achievement in the past 5 years that the BJP would not have accomplished ? What did the people gain from electing AAP over BJP the last time ? Regarding corruption and air pollution,  
1. What is AAP's agenda to improve EV Infrastructure in Delhi?  
2. Is AAP exploring blockchain technologies for land registration?   
3. Is there anything on the lines of [https://myap.e-pragati.in/](https://myap.e-pragati.in/) \- Citizen services for delhi? Does AAP plan to contest Mumbai BMC / Vidhan Sabha seats? I believe a lot of people in Mumbai are waiting for AAP to do here what you did in Delhi. Is your central leadership autocratic ? What initiatives have the party taken to provide visibility in decision making by the central comitee ? Pushkar Ji, hello.

I happen to live in Wazirabad village, which is a part of your constituency. What have you done for the betterment of this village, which is in dire straits in terms of quality of life and infrastructure. Are you planning to do something about the roads, and the cleanliness levels? Not a question, but a suggestion based on this AMA, twitter activities, and some public meetings.

AAP should sponsor some communication classes/seminar for its leaders. And at regular basis. As someone who is not from Delhi, we are not aware(shitty media) about the good things that AAP has done.

Can you list the things for Non-Delhiites? Do you use reddit regularly? If yes, then which subreddits? If no, then which social media platform do you like to use in your free time? \>  I have been doing politics with honesty and integrity.    


Pankaj Pushkar-ji, you said that you are doing politics with honesty and integrity. How can you help Indians from outside India make a difference? There are so many problems that they could help with. Do you have any plans to leverage the goodwill that the Indian diaspora have towards India? Can sisodiya's education model be implemented nationwide? And if yes how much time would it take to completely revamp the crippled education system?

Also if this is even possible given so many different governments in different states who are in constant state of conflict over ideologies and other things .. What are the steps (apart from free rides) taken by the AAP Govt in improving women safety? What happened to the 1.5 lakhs CCTV scheme? Will the AAP be implementing any further measures to curb air pollution? How much is the level/threshold of the diplomacy you have learnt to maintain as a politician?

Are there questions which you'd rather not answer in public if the answer, however correct it may be, might damage the image of your party given it is fairly young one? Why the AAP didnt install smog towers in delhi to curb pollution but resort to odd-even which oy targets men driving cars?

Whats was the idea behind making DTc bus travel free for women and proposing the same in delhi metro? what do you think of the schooling system in india? Congratulations on impressive work carried out to revive the dismal state of government schools and other related work in the field of education.  

A lot of people seems not aware of the same.   Won't this lack of awareness impact in upcoming elections? Is there any attempts made to bring back Kumar Vishwas, Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav? Sir, the budget allocation for SC and ST sub plan has not been satisfactory over the years neither it has been on par with planning commission and MSJE recommendations. Targeted allocation for SCSP and TSP is around 16% and 8% resp for the union, proportional to population. Delhi government has denied around 3000 crores for SC STs in 2018 alone. Delhi has a scheduled caste population of around 18%, the government funding for the welfare of the scheduled castes is only 2.5%.  I hope government takes measures to target these funds better in the coming years. Thanks for doing AMA. 
Here are few i have been involved in debating with other redditors: How come there's no law against moral policing? 

Are there any criminal actions against mob lynching?

can we see our future nation with sex education as a course in teenagers curriculum? What do you believe are the primary duties of an MLA?  Which public problems are solved by him instead of the CM or MP?  I know that MLA is for state legislation and MP for Parliament but apart from the legislation process what problems or issues is an MLA supposed to tackle? You say the journey has been full of hardships and personal sacrifices, could you explain that a bit more ? Also what's your thoughts on the measure to be taken for women safety in our country. My friend used to live in Government Quarters in Timarpur and one day when returning from college late evening (North Campus) he was about to have his wallet snatched but barely got away with it. Few months later I also saw two bikers snatching a lady's phone in North Campus very early morning. Shouldn't the capital set an example by eliminating at the very least these petty daylight crimes? Your thoughts? What steps are going to be taken to ensure safety for women in Delhi? 

Thank you for doing this 1) what changes the state status of Delhi bring ?
2) will the situation of women safety become better if delhi police was under delhi government?
3) what are you doing to fight evil people like Amit shah and co to win the delhi election ? What's your view on NRC and Citizen Amendment Bill? Would central government be able to implement NRC in Delhi without Delhi government's approval? A few questions:
1) what is the best way to know the local MLA/MP (by this I mean the kind of person he/she is)  
2) what according to you is something the voter is unaware of, but should be something everyone needs to know
3) how can individuals contribute more towards smooth functioning of democracy Pollution. Is any effort gonna go towards there. Please don't bother quoting the odd even, if that helped, every year the ppm wouldn't be higher than the last. Is anyone bothered about being accountable as the elected representatives. 
Is there anything being done or we're supposed to assume a long list of things other than your government's incompetence to blame on? So what are your thoughts on the decline in the GDP of India? Do you watch 'the Print' by Shekhar Gupta on YouTube? They are many educated yet untrained, unemployed engineers out there. Do you/your party have plans to help them either get a job or provide them training to get a job?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** P.S. I feel like this blunder happened after the center decided to fund majority of the money towards IITs, leading local college to brew up. If AAP wins election in any state other than Delhi , what steps will your party take to ensure police reforms in the state. What are your thoughts about mental health in India especially on Students and Young Adults also what can the government do to spread awareness and help countering this problem? What did your mom tell you when you were trying to pull open a door that said push?

Pankaj Pushkar! 

Also, what does AAP plan to do in Tamil Nadu in the future, and how strong is it here in TN? A common man who wants to get into politics not for looting people's money but actually helping them.
How would u guide him?

What do u think about the current gov formmed in Maharashtra? Thank you u/pankajpushkar for doing this AMA! My questions are as follows:

1) What are your plans for ensuring basic education for all?

2) Plans for encouraging scientific temper and increasing funding for research institutes?

3) Plans for encouraging start-ups?

4) How are you planning to invite foreign companies' investment to the state? 1. How much of money in total have been spent by AAP on advertisements. Every other day see I see advertisements of AAP like congratulations ABC area we have done this in your area. For each day of odd even  there were advertisement in newspaper telling me pollution is down by 25%. 
2. Which source AAP used to claim that pollution  is down by 25%? Why it wasn't cited in the advertisement itself?
3. Cultural programs by Delhi govt. is a good initiative. Thank you AAP for bringing classical music to people. Why is AAP quiet on conversion and division of a full state into  UTs while you yourself are fighting to convert Delhi into a full state ? 1. Do you think AAP became over ambitious and made mistake contesting 400+ Loksabha seats in 2014?  And in doing so, wasted donations from supporters?
2. Don't you think AAP should focus no big cities to begin with and fight BBMP (Bengaluru), BMC (Mumbai) first? With literally one month left for india to be a super power if your party owns the central Govt, How many years do you think  it would take to civilize people's behavior and bring india under UN light   as super power nation? 

And I am from southern part of india   where BJP is rejected like a fake profiles of tinder and never wanted a northie AMITHs to rule us? 

How do you think AAP can prove it's efficiency in southern india? where a govt who spent million $ in adv BJP party in  south  india and failed  


Or
Do you have plans to expand in south? 

N.B : by term south india I denote  Kerala and Tamil Nadu One of us one of us What are your solutions for unemployment of engineers ? How do you think is the main stream media shaping the presence of AAP government in India? What do you think about the state of Indian main stream media and how can it be  improved? Say,you come to power in Assam.What steps would you take for North-eastern States' representation on a national level? We have been either been under-represented or mis-represented. 

It's high time that people know about their culture,not as Hindus or Muslims, but collective history as Indians where almost each and every ethnicity is properly represented. What are your thoughts on communism? Is communism seen favorably by many AAP members? Hello Sir. How long do you think the recession will continue ? AAP maharashtra kab aaoge? What are your views on Rahul Gandhi? Hi.
There are lots of unrecognized slums in Delhi. Can you propose some solution for improving quality of life of people living there. Please do consider my solutions:-
1. Basic necessities of food, water and sanitation have to be met. Strengthening of anganwadi centres, constructing community sulabh toilets and provision of municipality drinking water ks important
2. Accessibility to urban health :- mohalla clinics are largely curative than preventive, and serve small purpose. Instead, slum health should again comcentrate on selective primary health care utilising urban asha workers and anganwadi workers ( for growth monitoring, ors, breastfeeding, immunization, female literacy, infant feeding and family planning methods) actively.
3. Nutritonal interventions such as subsidies, food for work etc are important, food security of families are important
4. There is a very high drugs and substance usage in these areas. It is a big problem amonh youth in these areas, and I fail to understand a good intervention for them.
5. Vocational courses and skill improvement of youth in these areas will help them move up the social ladder Reddit is the best place for criticism. AAP ready to accept criticism is half the battle won. I am not from Delhi but follower of AAP so no question about Delhi. One suggestion for all AAP Delhi is like Delhi Sultanate. So work hard guys.. Hey more power to  you 

So what has your party done?

And I hope the work your party does inspires the same back home in Pakistan >I am an Aam Aadmi AMA Is there anything you are planning to do to fight fake/paid media? It is really ruining minds and no one really talks about it. Maybe AAP can start talking about it, bringing it out to the people. Thanks for the AMA.Its great to see politicians reach out.What do you think about the growing threats to women safety in India?Has the situation got any better in Delhi?What steps did you take or plan to take?What are main causes of this problem?What can we do as citizens to get rid of this?Honestly I am very depressed and scared after seeing all the news coming from different parts of our country.Please answer. What are the plans for :

1. Cleaning Delhi's air quality, both long term and short term?
2. What are the plans for cleaning Yamuna, again both long term and short term? We don't need CCTV and wifi, they are tertiary needs for any citizen. Also i appreciate the reduced Electricity bill or i should rather say ""free"" because my usage is always below 200, and the new buses.

Can we get wide roads to drive on please? Roadside parking is a big nuisance in some areas, half or more than half of the road is covered by some idiot who parked it in middle of the road. Is it some way to call towing van and get the road cleared? Hi,

Do you support the idea of constant video surveillance of students in the classroom by parents and teachers? Is this not a gross violation of privacy and will it not psychologically effect the children by giving them no recourse for their natural self; so they constantly have to put up face and act unnaturally as if constantly performing in front of higher authority?

Children raised by helicopter parenting are not healthy for the society in the long run, and could lead to even more mental health problems in the long run.

&#x200B;

I would love to read your thoughts on this issue. Yeah need to take climate action, if you want to play the long game take action to protect the environment now. That is the need of the hour. All the money in the world won't be enough after 10 years, if actions to conserve the very planet we call home are not taken, you will be see people carrying oxygen tanks every now and then.

I can't say for you sir, but the thought of carrying fresh air to breathe is depressing. 

Globally we are organizing strikes to make all of you aware of this hazardous situation but everyone and i mean everyone is busy blaming others. 

We need strong politicians who will take action, else this country and the planet as a whole is doomed Why AAP is so socialist? Hello, I think AAP has been doing great work in Delhi, but I also feel that AAP hasn't quite developed its own policy on national issues yet, which might be an obstacle if it plans to fight elections at the state or national level. Hence, my questions are somewhat geared in that direction:

1. Is AAP planning to enter national politics on a larger scale? If yes, by when?
2. What is AAP's economic ideology? Does it believe in a trickle-down economic approach (tax cuts to the businesses in the hopes that they pass on the benefits to their workers) or does it believe in income redistribution (taxing the rich at a higher rate and using that money for the betterment of the poor)?
3. What is AAP's stand on the Kashmir issue? Should the LoC be made the permanent International Border in the interest of peace? Or would you push for having PoK reunited?
4. Is AAP for or against a Uniform Civil Code?
5. Is AAP in favour of or against privatisation of loss-making PSUs? Your views about jnu Do you ever feel glad about never having to look for your name in an alphabetical list? What would you have to say about the allegations about multiple MLA’s misusing tax funds and going on foreign trips, as mentioned by whistleblower Mishra. 
Along with the sex tape of your party leaders harassing and molesting Dalit females to f**k them for ration card. (Now that controversy is real, because the video evidence exists)
Lastly, what about the cores of money recovered from Arvind Kejriwal’s residence ? How do you plan on bringing faith back to the country, whereas when we saw your movement as beacon of light, in turned out to be an even worse representation of politics, corruption. Are you in favour of limiting number of terms for MPs/MLAs ? How does the AAP plan to fight the BJP (with their seemingly unlimited finances) in the next election? 1. Why is the specific cause of religious, especially hindu extremism and radicalization of youth in India we have seen recently?

2. Why are education costs ramping up where no average joe could afford it without going into the deep rabbit hole of dept?

3. Our education system promotes the people who can memorise things rather than have skills to get better colleges, this gives unfair advantage to people with a very specific skillset, do you think the way government colleges take in students should be more in line with countries in the west? 

4. Our law enforcement agencies are underpaid leading to lean towards more corrupted police officials. Is there anything being done to solve that? What does the AAP have in plan for the clean india campaign as well as environmental sustainability? What does aam aadmi mean?

*GWMF so Aam Aadmi (Hindi: आम आदमी, Urdu: عام آدمی) — literal translation: ""ordinary man"" (ām meaning ordinary + ādmī meaning man)

and here was me thinking it had something to do with original mangoes When will the AAP take pollution and climate change seriously instead of the farce of odd and even? 1)  I saw a TV interview of Arvind Kejriwal and when asked about the advantages ( and in effect why) odd even rule, he said something of the sort, that "" Gaadiyan kam chalegi, pollution thoda tho kam hoga na"".  I felt the answer ( and in extension the odd even rule) lacked any scientific basis. Did the AAP government do a scientific study to come up with this conclusion?. Why should the middle class of Delhi pay the price when the industries and the (poor ) farmers are the main polluters?

2) Where do you stand ( and in extension AAP)  with respect to economic capitalism?. Right/Center or left? And why do you think your idealogy ( or stand) will take India forward?

3)  Is reservation solving Caste inequality in our country? Do you believe it should be extended to the private sector?

4)  What is your view on the emigration and the brain drain happening in India. How will a hypothetical AAP government react to it or solve it? How do you stay hopeful after taking a bath in the dirty pond that is Indian politics? Do you really think that there is any hope for our country considering that most institutions are comprised and taken over by BJP? Also will you re-strengthen RTI if your party is ever elected? I thought ninjas a stroke
Reading that title firstly it is a breath of fresh air when some indian politician comes out in public like this and I appreciate it greatly ?

Why hasn't APP expanded beyond borders of delhi ? I would love to vote for it if I had an option. P.S i live in himachal

secondly, I want to know more about the education policy of APP ? what are the short and long term goals ? As a former AAP supporter who was turned off by Arvind throwing out any credible opposition from the party (including many others who were equal participants in the anti corruption movement), do you have any views that would help one be optimistic about the AAP? Do you ever foresee a future in which Arvind will play second fiddle to another leader within AAP? Why is Delhi still not clean even after modi clean initiatives? Isnt it something Delhi govt should actively work on or it's something falls under central again? Free Wi-Fi ka kya hua ? Do you think AK is afraid of other leaders  gaining traction within party?

Why did Yogendra yadav had to leave? MLAs and ministers often go on foreign tours to Western countries to observe the local govt's civic body working. 

* Why is that take-back-home lessons are absolutely zero? 
* Aren't you and colleagues disgusted looking at open drains, broken footpaths, potholed roads, pollution everywhere, etc. when you come back? Don't you feel like fixing our cities? 
* When can we expect solid infrastructure and processes like those developed countries? Does AAP plan to run in goa? Your views on cryptocurrencies and blockchain Whats your party's stand on Free Electricity and water after elections and how do your government will handle the loss of revenue by putting everything Free. When is weed getting legalized How about making a partnership with Congress ? if you keep fighting with each other you will just divide the Vote and let BJP win. Don't have a question but wanted to say that I am based in Bombay and every time I visit Delhi I am just amazed by the cleanliness of the city. I wish you guys all the best and hope you make it to my city as well. What do you say about your IT cell creating thousands of twitter bots to retweet Mr Kejriwaal and an army of people generating tweet content?

What's the point of AAP if you indulge in exactly same stuff as your opponents BJP and Congress? I work at TOI, Goa 

Can I publish this if possible? Can you take any effective step to improve air quality, other than odd even. I read the other day that China curbed it's air pollution using giant air filters that also harbored the carbon monoxide it collected to form black diamond like things which were sold commercially. Can we do something like that? It was announced this year that the AAP government had purchased and deployed 1000 road cleaning trucks. Later in an informal interview given by your deputy CM, it was revealed that 1000 machines had been ordered, not delivered at that time.

How many trucks have been delivered so far, and how many more have been paid for? What are the financial aspects of the deal, and how much of the order is being manufactured (not assembled) in India? u/pankajpushkar

So, recently the Government of India is trying to ban all vape products under the pretext that ""It's to save the youth of India from vaping addiction""

What are your thoughts on this? If the more dangerous versions of similar nicotine products are available (I'm talking about cigarettes and tobacco products), then is the government right in justifying the ban despite allowing literally any other nicotine product to exist out there?\\

And finally, is AAP aware of this and is your political party aware of this? first of all , great job all around guys. 

I know you guys are giving registries for unauthorised colonies. But does this not give people incentive to just grab land? why should someone buy land with his hard earned wages when someone across the road can grab government land and competes for resources like water, electricity and raods that his tax money pays for?

also, can we do away with the adverse posession laws in delhi. with land so expensive this just gives incentive for land mafias to grow. Is there a conscious effort to combat climate change within the party? Indian population is very vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Winter is here, I want to ask you about homeless shelters in delhi. Delhi estimated homeless population is believed around 1,25,000 while max occupancy in homeless shelters are around 8500.
I have seen many labourers and Rickshaw pullers sleeping on streets in extreme winters with just a blanket. what steps did your Government took in this issue and how can homelessness can be reduced ? Thanks. I must commend you for the work AAP has done with regards to education and health sector....but there are other sectors that this AAP govt has ignored. Delhi suffered from a lack of initiative in infra sector throughout duration of present AAP govt.

One of the major causes of pollution is lack of public transportation. No of buses in delhi has significantly reduced during the duration of present govt. 

Also dont you think by offering heavy subsidies in power, water and transportation sector, AAP is doing essentially the same as many other political parties in India i.e. offering freebies? This looks like a short term solution for problems that require sustained effort over a long time. [deleted] What keeps you optimistic about our country? Because I've lost all hopes for our country. Hi Pankaj!

Please let me know what you can do for plantation in Delhi. What are your thoughts on today’s encounter? Aap aam kese khate ho? What is your stand in the hindi imposition in non-hindi speaking states ? [removed] Unpopular & I may be downvoted to oblivion for this:        
       
What is your and your party's stand on the demand for formation of a ""Men's Commission"". Delhi sees a huge number of fake rape cases, fake molestation cases, and cases of misuse in 498A, DV act etc. It is also responsible for a large part of Male Suicides. While the security and safety of women is very important, what steps are you taking to make sure that innocent men and their families don't suffer? [removed] Reservation in jobs and education is not helping to overcome the caste bias that's present in the society .

Udhav be like ...arey hey Kay chalu ahe? Just woke up and was reading The Hindu, first page says Uddhav to be MH CM. 

Gets this notification. Ok... Chal kya Raha hein BC so many plot twists for one seat ...🤷‍♂️ Incredible. What would be interesting is the next election pre poll alliances

Will NCP and Congress run together again? Or will NCP run in an alliance with BJP? 

Or will all four parties fight on their own? What's certain is BJP and Shiv Sena won't run on their own. Shah be like,"" I am gonna do what's called a PRO-Gamer move"". Well well well, look how the turntables... Sharad Pawar just played everyone like a damn fiddle Shiv Sena be like  ""Hum mandir me gaye to boondi Khatam hogayi aur bahar nikle toh chappal gayab thhe."" I think BJP deliberately waited for Sena to announce that UT is going to be CM and then pull the rug from under, just to embarrass them. Game of Throne - Maharashtra edition

When you play game of throne you either win or die there is no middle ground :P

Red Wedding for Shiv Sena What the fuck 2019 is basically trying to compensate for a disappointing Game of thrones finale Opportunism at its finest by NCP. Is sab ke beech mein think about Congress. It is really pushing itself towards irrelevance here. 

It cant take decisions (fast enough), and it cant force someone's hand. BC chal kya raha hai congress mein. This is the epic political drama! Political surgical strike. Perhaps the most Machiavellian move ever in Indian politics.

EDIT - it also shows, how to conduct negotiations. I’m not fan of BJP but BJP as a party acted with absolute discipline. None of their big leaders came on cameras to talk about their ambitions last few weeks despite sitting CM and largest party. In the background they were working with precision and discipline. Shiv Sena CM vs. 1 Enforcement Directorate boii.

Who wins? As someone who hates BJP, Modi and Shah to the very core, I can't yet help appreciate their political acumen. I really can't stop laughing at this outcome. Coalition government is the worst. No ethics, no idealogy, no self- respect.
Few months ago, Sharad Pawar was supposed to join Chidambaram in jail for corruption.. Shiv sena is gone... Finished https://twitter.com/PawarSpeaks/status/1198088033150500865


>Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his. Uddhav to be MH new CM. It's literally on the first page of Hindu Today
Wtf happend in the night Still not sure if Ajith pawar has split from NCP along with some MLAs or this is a party decision. Shiv Aroor: Shiv Sena & Congress doubly damaged here? They dumped their ideologies very publicly to make a union possible. Changed into new clothes very publicly so the dance could happen. But the dance didn’t. So they’re now left standing awkwardly in clothes they otherwise publicly hate.

Oh shit. Burn This deserves a Rains of Castamere rendition When politics turned into Splitsvilla 💕 Lols. Not sure why NCP has made such a bold move. Little finger like politics right there So president's rule can be removed at any time and suddenly? Can someone /r/outoftheloop me here? bjp can just never accept defeat you've to give it to them Everything is possible in politics, holy shit I am waiting for Ramdas Athavale's kavita on this issue LMAO wtf pawar is the winner of Maharashtra version of GoT [Govinda Govinda Govinda Gooo-viiin-daaa](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQik3CsLNxRzANNLZ2cFi7rL8O2K_Ke4j1IzCC965IL7aanTTA3) Khuleaam chutiya bana diya gaya.  

Waah mudi ji, waah!! My take is Ajit pawar has revolted against his uncle....
Sharad Pawar yesterday told that he has proposed uddhav name...why so much of change within few hours.

There is more drama unfolding within NCP.
Ajit pawar had disappeared for 3 days just after elections results were announced. That was considered as a pressure tactic by him to make himself the defacto heir of Sharad pawar.
Reason being Sharad pawar is Keen to promote  Rohit pawar as his next heir ... This has to go down as the biggest klpd in Indian politics Rebel MLAs are sitting with Sharad Pawar in press conference... guess its still not done deal for BJP. Oh My Fucking God !!! Did not expect that. Top 10 Anime Betrayals How vaild is Kattapa news.

>Out of 35 @NCPspeaks MLAs , the 25 are newly elected who are close to @AjitPawarSpeaks Governor gave 7 days to this govt. to prove majority. That's convenient. 

  sharad pawar broke off from Congress to form NCP because of ideological differences. It seems his nephew ajit pawar gave sharad pawar the same pill he served Congress back in the day for betraying party lines going back with Congress.

 Who knows what can happen next this is some games of thrones level stuff without blood and grore...[until now](https://imgur.com/a/U2TJtU5).


Edit : Looking at the news and further development of this situation. I now firmly believe Netflix or prime should invest into making a Thriller TV show purely based on indian politics. GAME OF THRONES - BJP Edition ;-) Uddhav ki goti Sharad ke haath me

Ajit ki goti Amit ke haath me

Amit ne daba di Modi said Devendra will be the CM. 
Like a devout, Amit Shah made it happen. Say whatever, this is truly masterstroke.

I wonder what 'deal' must have been made for Sharad Pawar to accept this alliance! Am i the only one crying in joy? I absolutely love to see arrogant parties who don't get majority votes but try to control and get things thier way simply for the sake of the seat, get absolutely destroyed? 

Shiv Sena absolutely deserves this, all they fought for was for the CM seat, and now they eat dirt.

People's mandate never dictates a party that failed to get majority to pull the strings, I always hated that. Now one can say the NCP also pulled strings but yeah they didnt become CM. I was talking about being greedy for he CM seat. 🤣

(agedlikemilk overnight lol) News Flash: SS blames Flash for changing the time line... If bjp and ajit pawar fails to prove majority at floor test then there's a chance of forming ncp, shivsena and inc government. In this way they are able to stop the presidential rule in maharashta due to help of bjp. But muh Sena CM....... Priyanka chaturwedi just got bamboozled 😂 amit shah chanakyaniti once again, shiv sena greed cost them from greed for cm post to now having nothing Shiv sena should be ready for the corruption charges, raids, etc etc. Aaditya thakrey should immediately leave for higher studies abroad. My theory to what happened in Maharashtra

NCP - Congress meeting was underway. 

If you look at [pictures](https://youtu.be/2Ah_qker730?t=40) of the meeting, Sharad Pawar and Ahmed Patel are sitting in middle and Congress-NCP leaders are sitting next to them.

You can see Sharad Pawar's daugher Supriya Sule sitting behind on a chair.

NCP Number 2, Ajit Pawar is missing from the meeting (My bad, he was there, 45 second mark)

Please have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5PkbdnCnb0) of Ajit Pawar by BBC Marathi.

The reporter asks Ajit Pawar about the meeting.

Translation of what Ajit Pawar said ( He is visibly angry )- ""I don't know anything, I am going back to Baramati""
S
o what is probably happening is, NCP is currently breaking in two parts.

Most (or all) NCP MLAs might support Ajit Pawar for these reasons

1. Sharad Pawar is already living on borrowed time given his age and health, So most MLAs would side with Ajit Pawar as Supriya Sule was never that stong of a contendor for Sharad Pawar's seat.

2. Amit Shah must have financed Ajit Pawar to buy NCP MLAs to vote in their favour

3. BJP must have promised NCP not to send ED/IT/CBI behind their Mulshi Pattern scams in Maharashtra.  

Biggest Losers - Probably Shiv Sena and Congress. Even if we have re elections they will be crushed. NCP's Maratha  fanbase from Sugar belt and Pune won't stop voting for them. Shiv Sena's voters might move to BJP.

In my opinion, senior Pawar did not know about what is happening, But he too might be a part of this plan because he went to [meet Modi](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-to-meet-pm-narendra-modi-in-parliament-today-to-discuss-farmers-crisis-amid-maharashtra-2135366) to discuss 'farmer crisis' Chuckles.

 Last night on Reddit I read some people congratulating the Shivsena, NCP and Congress for successfully stoping the BJP.  I was thinking if it was too early to celebrate. 

I was also reading by some journalists that the Marathas were the only people who successfully held their own against the Mughals and the East India Company, implying they held out against BJP as well. This all makes me laugh. Whoever wins it's sad realize that we as a common man has lost . Democracy has failed again . This one time I was wrestling with my friend in my village, we were about equal in strength but I was lazy as fuck and he was quick. So we were locked together and he was about to take me down on my back, as we were falling, I turned around him midair and he ended up on his back instead of me. 

That's kinda what happened to Shiv Sena here. Looks like Ajit Pawar has broken the party line. Sharad Pawar tweeted this 10 min back.

> When @PawarSpeaks decided to appear before the ED office that day evening @AjitPawarSpeaks shockingly resigned as MLA and was not traceable for many hours. He is under tress of ED notice & does not want to take risk of his possible arrest. Joining @BJP4Maharashtra is safe for him.

Shiv Sena and INC deserve this just for being stupid. 8 out of 11 rebel NCP MLAs have returned to Sharad Pawar and claimed they didn't had any prior knowledge about situation.

Dilip Bankar, one of the eleven MLAs who was present for the swearing-in ceremony at the Raj Bhawan on Saturday morning, has tweeted that he is still very much with the NCP. Expressing belief in party chief Sharad Pawar's leadership, the MLA from Niphad claimed that he had no information of what would take place at the Raj Bhavan. He also reiterated his commitment ot the party's position.

This shows how far ahead HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy are in terms of politics in India. They did this a good 5-6 years ago. Since when did your presidents & governers start working at 5am?

Also, the president can invoke/revoke president rule at his wish? Without any checks or verification or approvals? Idk what to think. Is this a double bluff by Sharad Pawar to humiliate both Ajit and BJP. This way he can groom his grandson as the new heir of NCP. Remember : Pawar broke Sena of Balasaheb and took Chagya and other 27 MLAs Peshwa and Marathas joining forces. Ramdas Athavale promising portfolio to Pawar.

I am dying.😂😂😂😂 Sanjay raut on twitter""log jispe haste hain woh hi history banate hai"" Amir Shah be breaking party and family for lulz. Who wants Netflix and Prime...when we have such dramas... Yahan pe chutya Shivsena ka nahi,
Sharad pawar ka kata Hain If a common man needs justice... He has wait years for it. As these bigwigs will immediately ask supreme court to intervene and demand justice on the same day.  Democracy ki jai ho! Maharashtra elections are a joke for our democracy. Will be fun if BJP fails the floor test. Should have seen this coming when Modi praised NCP in his tweet. However, this raises questions about the alliance. Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar both have cases pending against them. Modi-Shah must have given them immunity of some sort. 

Only proves that BJP isn't that serious about tackling corruption and willing to compromise on their principles just to get in power just like how people accused Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress for. Losing faith in this country slowly every day. Kind of expected this from BJP. The real winners here are NCP who blindsided everyone- holy shit. This man has more principles than these politicians

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/thief-performs-penance-prays-before-stealing-durga-crown/articleshow/72175277.cms Wtf....this is called planning and execution... I mean, nobody seriously thought BJP was not trying to work this out with NCP right? They just need 10 people. Wait a fucking minute! What????? Shiv Sena : Those bastards lied to us. At least one good thing out of all this. That cancerous party Shiv Sena is done. Uddhav Thackeray? More like Udhhvasta Thackeray Woke up and saw notification for this post on my phone. 
Checked it and read the first comment, realised it's a joke and a good one at that, had a good chuckle and went back to sleep. 
Finally woke up, and checked today's IE print edition. Yep, Uddhav will be CM like it was supposed to be. 
Fired up the laptop, browsed around internet and finally visited IE website.
AREY MC!! YEH KYA HO GAYA?? This is the kind of plot twists we deserved in GoT Top 10 anime betrayals And Bollywood gets the script for a new movie House of cards and thrones, Marathi edition Can’t wait for Anurag Kashyap to make a movie out of this. this still going on https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1198269088901910528 Shiv Sena proved themselves as the biggest loser in all this. Does not look like too many NCP MLAs actually supported Ajit on this or they thought Sharad Pawar knew about it. BJP jumped the gun it seems. Does someone feel that these are desperate attempts. The Duo has run out of the pro BJP gas they claimed and not left with these desperate measures. End is near mitro!! Uddhav to BJP: we won’t support you unless I get the CM seat

Amit Shah: Im gonna end this man’s whole career Oath was taken in the morning 545 am presidential rule was removed at 5 am without any cabinet approval 

Sanjay raut: raat ke andhere mai sarkar banai ki chori karli esa daku or chor raat mai apne kaam karte hai According to BJP few days back, NCP- National corrupt party. Politics based on ideology is long dead. I have mixed feelings for this coalition. But it is much much better/stable than whatever Shiv Sena was trying to cook...people who have observed MH politics will know.

I voted for Devendra Fadnavis to be CM. He and many more under his leadership have worked hard for Maharashtra in last 5 years. 

I know...this will be downvoted..cuz most people in this subreddit will criticize anything BJP and cheer anything Not BJP. If buying MPs like vegetables is Chanakya Niti then every Indian aunty is one. Bhakts must be crowing on how “good” has triumphed over the unholy, evil alliance. This is indeed Ram Rajya where everyday is a miracle for Bhakts. Lol...i got a news notification around 8am from The Hindu app saying Uddhav Thackeray became new CM of maharashtra. I opened that link and read few lines then closed it. Now when i saw this post on reddit i went again to check only to find out they removed that post. I thought MNS and NCP had some sort of alliance? Because they didn't field any candidates against each other. (I know, I know, naive question....)

Also, is it that only Ajit Pawar went off the track? Without consulting Sharad Pawar? Rumour has it so apparently. I read the newspaper before checking the news on my phone today morning... Was in a for a ridiculous surprise Lol what the fresh fuck! Isse kehte hain muh se nivala chinna Top ten plot twists of all the time People, The drama isn't over yet. Let them prove majority. Petition to nickname Amit Shah as 'Clutch Minister' Ajit Pawar would have been deputy CM anyway, then why did he defect? Sharad pawar the mastermind
Made shiv sena break their alliance
Now he is playing in government as well as opposition
Bjp must be credited for one thing
Secrecy Got off my flight and saw this news. At the time of boarding, the Thackeray was about to take the oath. Will be landing in Mumbai in about 9 hours. Wonder what will change by then. Still they have to show the numbers,Government is not yet formed. Good! Some government at last after a month! My view is this deal between Sharad Pawar and BJP was agreed quite some time back. The reason why they delayed the govt formation is to cause maximum damage to Congress. Now Congress is seen openly negotiating for power with Shiv Sena for two weeks. Their leaders meeting Sena leaders have been all over the news. This will cause huge damage to the Congress in future elections.

Also, amazing how the BJP managed the whole thing in secret. Not one word of it was leaked to the media. The media was so busy leaking details of Cong-Sena-NCP arrangement that they missed the actual coup. Just going to leave this [tweet](https://twitter.com/Dev_Fadnavis/status/515472664089985025?s=19) from our CM and leave. Literally in all the news, BJP was not even mentioned a single time. This is amazing. Hopes for metro and bullet train is up and running now! Imagine if sharad told ajit to pretend to support bjp and take 11 mla and when bjp think they are about to make the government, fadnavis be cm, let mla's defect one by one until they dont have majority, and fadnavis and bjp got made the biggest joke in indian politics lmao Governor Raj Bhavan me raat ko Randi chodne gaya tha kya Bjp got rid of shiv Sena in a fkin big way ... NCP = House Bolton Bjp to ShivSena yeh aap ke saath prank hua hai woh dekho camera Can anyone ELI5 to me about what happened?  I don't have much knowledge about Indian politics. Gotta be honest. I didn't see it coming. this is some GoT stuff right here! pretty brutal by bjp > Ajit Pawar's decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).

Also, how much of an overlap is there between NCP and BJP? BJP intends to bring the Uniform Civil Code in mere months, will this state government break apart then? aaj ki politics dekh ke maje aagaye 😂😂 Bjp sumdime kumbdi mar gayi So bad for india.

I’m not familiar with the political players in Maharashtra. Atleast this alliance has completely exposed BJP for the hypocrisy it is. It won the 2014 elections on the stand that it would fight corruption, but now has willingly partnered with the corrupt Ajit pawar to keep their power. All those right wingers who are hailing it as a master stroke better also remember that their party has reduced themselves to the same level as Congress. > Uddhav Thackeray: Earlier EVM khel was going on and now this is new khel. From here onwards I don't think elections are even needed.Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when betrayed and attacked from the back.

Opposition needs to stop spreading this nonsense This was expected from NCP, coz shiv sena will be stubborn in government and it will create problems. NCP has to support someone to help farmer issue Ugh I am dreading the chankya kautilya media spin this will get and ignore the unconstitutional act. Also somebody pls speak up about the governor being more a BJP stooge than a independent constitutional authority. Say what you will of Amit shah but he went here full super Saiyan Amit Shah is modern day Chanakya Nice to see a Thackeray get fucked by Maharashtra instead of having to watch a Thackeray fuck Maharashtra for a change. Shiv Sena deserved this I thought bjp fanbois were saying bjp would never go with ncp and Congress Bhenchod, tabhi ye neta log 75-80 tak jeete hai.

Saheb is feigning ignorance.

Or the party is indeed broken. Sharad Pawar was obviously given the choice between becoming the next Chidambaram or the next Thackarey..  he opted for the latter.  :p 'Dhobi ka Kutta' has seen better days than guys at SS. This is is some major ekta kapoor tv show twist [Samna's headline today](https://imgur.com/a/uFa6D9Z)

Samna is Shiv Sena's newspaper by the way. Out of all the parties they could break they went for NCP? That's new. Basic question - Is this good for Mumbai and Maharasthra? Can anyone explain this all to me in simple terms from the start.....it will be greatly appreciated 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thank God. Work in Nagpur won't be throttled now. Nagpur the political centre of India 🙏🏼 Rumor has it that Ajit Pawar was picked up from morning walk to take oath for D-CM. /s Are there any exceptions under the anti defection law?

Yes, legislators may change their party without the risk of disqualification in certain circumstances. The law allows a party to merge with or into another party provided that at least two-thirds of its legislators are in favour of the merger. In such a scenario, neither the members who decide to merge, nor the ones who stay with the original party will face disqualification.



Ajit has 2/3rd legislators. Now I understand where has that Rs 4500 crores has gone. Buying MLAs is not cheap and can't be declared. SUPERPOWER 2020 INCOMING!

* or re-elections in maharashtra will happen

Save this comment and come back after a year Nationalists alligned with anti- national part-2.
People are the real loser they fight for these people. Its matter of time RSS will lose it's ideology Tag. I don't think it's amit  Shah who turned the tables, it was all along sharad pawar. this is why pawar cant be trusted,old fossil is no use to secularism,this is why he met PM few days ago.

secular parties should never let pawar to be near them.bad day for Maharashtra. Bad time for Utsav to out his tweets. Everybody will forget about that now. Uddhav Thackeray aur sacche aashiq mein yahi similarity hai. 

Jis pal ka dono ko besabri se intezaar hota hai, uske theek pehle unka gande wala kat jaata hai. Can somebody please explain wtf is going in my state I don't get it... I really wished NCP-Shivsena-congress should've formed a govt. Not because I like them but, just because they were less probable to screw us Maharashtrians, just because of the fear of a no confidence motion. 
And Devendra needs to to be kept away from the seat as he just seem way too hungry for power. 
I really hoped for a change even though its insignificant as everyone is the same. 
But I'm definitely marking the 30th on my calendar as another interesting day....
The season finale of game of throne would be premiering and i wanna watch it live(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ If a faction of MLAs supported by Ajit Pawar, has supported BJP in the formation; than it is worrisome. You can expect wholesale buyout of MLAs by the BJP.

Its pretty evident. Modi and other BJP leaders are only congratulating Ajit Pawar and not NCP/Sharad Pawar.

The only winner in this saga, is Sharad Pawar and NCP.

Maharashtrians will hate BJP more and more. This overshadows the media potrayal that new govt was not possible due to Uddhav Thackeray's and Shiv Sena's greed.

You can expect a sympathy wave for Sharad Pawar and Shiv Sena in coming days. People on the ground aren't going to forget this.

People can cheer Amit Shah and BJP for all they want, but this is death of democracy. The real mastermind here is Sharad Pawar. And with this BJP has proven that they have zero morals and zero credibility. They will definitely do anything to get into power. I'm sure one day they'll ally even with Congress if they got the chance to keep power. 

Tough luck Sena, but when you lay with dogs you wake up with fleas. All Hail Mota Bhai Indian politics is a joke isn't it..? This is on the face democratic corruption. Republic TV was used as a  tool for coercion by showing an alleged Ajit Pawar corruption while the  government itself did nothing much about it. Ajit Pawar is now with BJP,  corruption case closed. If Modi-Shah are not corrupt power politicians  then nobody is. Supreme court can only see money trail, corruption for  power is accepted hence legalized by the Supreme court in India. Is this some kind of a fucking joke? President's rule can be imposed and invoked at Modi's will?

Why even call this country a democracy any longer? Everyone here celebrating what a move. Fuck this move. One more nail in the coffin of Indian democracy. If BJP was okay with a deputy CM post, what was all this drama for in the first place Eli5 someone"
Politics,Delhi govt creating hype on pollution issue for political reasons: Centre,168,e0v5p6,https://m.timesofindia.com/city/delhi/delhi-govt-creating-hype-on-pollution-issue-for-political-reasons-centre/articleshow/72187039.cms,22,,sir_qoala," Tch. Kejriwal should know only mandir and Hindutva are true issues for politics. Rookie mistake. We will allow it Thomas had *cough* *cough* never heard such bull-*cough*-shit before. If Delhi govt are creating a hype on pollution would't it affect them negatively. Why would kejriwal do that? Okay, if only 3% of the pollution is due to stubble burning, then answer the following:

1. Based on what data are you claiming that stubble burning only contributes 3% to the total pollution levels of Delhi, especially during the months where stubble burning is widespread?
2. What are the sources of the remaining 97% of pollution?
3. Of that 97%, how much pollution is generated within the NCT, and how much is generated outside?
4. What steps has the central government taken to get states contributing to Delhi's pollution levels to bring those causes under control?
5. Have both central and state governments implemented orders by the NGT and if not, what is preventing them from doing so?
6. Has the Delhi government taken effective steps in curbing pollution generated within the NCT? If not, why have you not pulled them up despite being located in the same jurisdiction and therefore being equally affected by it? Oh dear, what if we create a better world for nothing? As if this government doesn't follow that policy by themselves..... BJP ministers compete with each other to see who can say the most fucked up stupid shit and get away with it. This should be posted to r/worldnews to shame kaka Non RSS-BJP state gormints want to improve the lives of their citizens for political reasons - RSS-BJP central gormint 

Also ""Ignore horse-trading and twisting of rules that happened in MH and Karnataka "" - RSS-BJP cetral gormint Bhakts living in Delhi : ""what the fuck are you saying? Even I can't defend that statement. Idhar kutta bhi saans nai le paa raha aur tum madharchodo kuch bhi bhaunke jaa rahe ho.""
Btw any bjp supporter living in delhi, what is your response to this 99999iq statement? Don't let pollution talk die with Diwali ke patake. Diwali is over but pollution is still here like it was before. I'd say wait stubble burning to end too. Then we will have real talk. sala ee bhajpa wale saans nahi lete ka? After reading the article it looks the minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said the blaming of farmer is for political reason (since he says that only 3% of pollution is due to farmers)

They didn't say that there's no pollution issue. This is so correct. Delhi just wants people to stop using cars or whatever so they can keep building the idiotic metro and take up space from actual residents. The whole thing is a farce. Imo."
Politics,Should political parties be forced to pay 30% of their income as a tax to the Central and State governments respectively?,55,e7gjky,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7gjky/should_political_parties_be_forced_to_pay_30_of/,10,"Well, the title speaks for itself.

[I recently read this article](https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/bjp-congress-rishest-candidates-crorepati-lok-sabha-elections-1525197-2019-05-15) and it made me wonder about the connection between state and central government job cutbacks and the networth of these assholes who order the cutbacks in the first place.

Every single state or central government funded institute is starving and has been receiving cutbacks left and right and in the mean time, these fucking assholes are literally planning to develop entire privately owned townships to make more money.

Should all political parties be forced to pay 30% of their donation revenue to the Central and State government respectively? The split would be 15-15, where there would be a sharing pool between all states and the money would be distributed according to the population distribution ratios in those respective states.

I mean, afterall these guys are doing this for their country right? So they shouldn't have a problem with strengthening the economical backbone of their dying country by these donations.

I know it's a naive post and this shit is never going happen, but one can dream.

Edit : A few typos and formatting.",accfordota," i’m a chartered accountant and well versed in tax. 

Political Parties do not pay any tax on any income like capital gains , income from house property, income from other sources.

But if government starts taxing these parties the black economy will get affected ,

Bcoz most of the money is converted from white to black happens here.

People with high income give donations to political party and get a deduction while computation of total taxable income and on the other hand they collect back the donation in from of black cash 

Political party in this way gets white cash for their expenditures.

If someone wants to curb this corruption he / she should start with taxing these political parties . The issue is - Only a Finance Bill can levy new taxes and guess who passes the Budget? It may seem like the parties disagree on everything but underneath the shouting and fighting, there are a large pool of issues that none of the parties will take the right stand on becauss those issues are counter productive to all of them regardless of who is in power.

CIC notified that political parties are under RTI and need to disclose their sources of funding a long time back. ALL the parties defy the order to disclose to this day. No. Instead, political parties should be required to publicise every single donor, and corporate donations should be completely banned. I say 100%, but then again, I ain't making the rules."

modi-shah are the biggest fucking hypocrites in recent memory. I think we all should know by now these guys are the biggest hypocrites around. They further enhance their hypocrisy with selective or convenience based amnesia. Modi and Shah mock Congress for dynastic politics but if Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi decide to join BJP, just the way many Congress leaders have done in the recent past, Modi and Shah would not have a problem. They would gladly welcome them. Modi and Shah do not have a problem with the dynasts. They do not have a problem with the Nehru-Gandhi family also. It is just a smokescreen. It keeps the idiots (voters) busy because they need two sides of the coin even when there is no coin to toss. Menaka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi are from the same dynasty and they are fine in BJP. Modi and Shah do not have a problem with Congress as such either. Its problem is with opposition. There should not be any opposition to BJP's hegemony. A mafia does not want opposition. It either lets the members of the opposition become part of the mafia or it eliminates the opposition. BJP does not want a Congress-Mukt Bharat. It wants an Opposition-Mukt Bharat so that no one is there to question them. My friends, you are living under a dictatorship but at least for some time you can afford to fool yourself by saying that India is the world's largest democracy and that is because you get the chance every now and then to fool yourself by undergoing the charade of election in which, as the BJP leader claimed, no matter which button is pressed, only BJP gets the vote. Chunavi Jumla Their CM comes from a long line of a dynasty. His entire family is in BJP, including aunts Sab waese hi hain. Congress bjp AAP or jo bhi baaki ki changu mangu parties. Cocksucking is top talent at BJP as they have born in congress 😂 Maine kaha..... False equivalence. in Congress (and ShivSena, BSP, RJD etc) dynasty rules at the top. U remove the dynasty from top in these parties and they will cease to exists. Modi/Shah/Vajpayee/Advani etc haven't littered their own progenies to lead BJP/RSS You are mistaking dynasty politics.
Unlike congress, You can't become president of BJP or chief minister just because you are son of a politician .

You have to rise through the ranks , get respect among grassroot workers , fight rebellions to become powerful within party.

Sadly in those sections of society you can only get votes by being their hero or their god, not their friend. Funny thing is that people hero worship Ambedkar too.

Well, most private institutions can simply ban politics Amity waley are most peaceful. Down vote me \m/ First thing, only 1% of students takes part in 99% of demonstrations. Rest just study and are busy with their work.

I think political activities are strong in these unis because of presence of political parties from a very long time + presence of bright minds.

Established parties gives funds and other support to student unions. They recruit bright minds every year and this cycle goes on year after year. It's a feedback loop. These universities allowed protests more than others at some point, so they attract students who want to be more active. Now because the students are so active, the university can't easily stop the protests.

It's part of their culture now similar to culture of a city, an office or a community. Being politically aware and active is a good thing.

You could argue on whether they are good politicians or not but India needs more grassroots movements to speak out for the weaker than the usual heirs James Baldwin - ""To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time. ""

It's not that you join and are assumed to just take part in a protest. In JNU at least, what happens is that you join, and learn about so many different issues that don't normally permeate your consciousness. You hear stories of caste violence from peers who've directly felt it. You learn about the structural inequalities that perpetuate India's underdevelopment. You learn about political, social, economic theories that explain all these issues  you see constantly, and that education gives you power. 

What you then have is a large cohort of other students who feel the same way, and that gives you solidarity and the belief that you actually *can* speak out against the things you would have otherwise just cursed about to yourself while keeping quiet. Well. Because those universities tend to have active students unions. I wonder why universities with a lot of privileged people don’t protest. \\s [deleted] Because it's the culture of that University. Also, this is a good identifier of a shitty University. Kaam dhande nahin hain toh karengey kya. It's simple

These unis have courses like political science and other humanities and arts courses.

Those students have much much much more time than say, engineering or medical.


Free time is the main reason. They basically have to spend time somehow lol. Absolute nuts"

Politics,"How to get away with murder, police edition ~ Kruttika Susarla",3689,e7ak0n,https://i.redd.it/g7utyg36g5341.jpg,260,,anonymouse_2001," Encounter 40% people in parliament with cases registered against women Tbh even I was happy when I heard about the encounter. But then when I thought about it, I understood how wrong it is. Just think, what if the actual culprit was powerful and connected enough that he got away with it by framing some innocents as the culprits? What if the police were in on it and framed these guys due to political pressure? The real culprit will get away with it due to such encounters. This is what we need the courts and the trials for. 
I am with the majority public to give the harshest punishment and the most painful death to the real rapists. But the thing is, in such cases how can we be sure that these were the real ones?

But then again the case might have run in court for years and the real culprits, even if guilty, might not have been as severely punished. 
This actually shows the failure of the Indian Judiciary and the how the law simply doesn't provide the appropriate justice. Because the outrage of the public initially for the incident and then the support for this encounter only shows that everyone knows that our law simply doesn't work and thus they believe that the only way to give such monsters(the rapists) the punishment they deserve is doing it out of the courts. And the people are not wrong when they think like this, because our judiciary has almost always failed us in the past. Maybe that's what needs to be changed. Man explaining to people why this is a bad thing is such a taxing and meaningless climb, better to just keep my shut and go study or watch Kurzgesagt.

You can’t explain shit to a people so biased and narrow minded, you’re the ultimate loser in trying to make sense and explain lol

Edit: letter >'She must have eloped'

Context please. It’s very hard to convince people what police did was wrong. Because people are sick and tired of our slow judiciary. People want quick justice they don’t care if it’s done by police. Bhai ye cartoon Facebook story me daala tha. Galiya pad rahi hai. Thanku. I'm from /r/all and trying to get context on the situation, it seems like there was a sexual assault and instead of police work and the judiciary system going through their regular process there was vigilante justice in mob form, like a lynching?

I could be completely wrong here but I'm gaining bits of context from all the different comments could someone throw me a link to catch up? There is no defence for Police's behavior or attitude towards general public. Its pathetic.

But I would like to play devil's advocate and point one biggest problem in our police system, the number of Police Personnel per population.

>Data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) shows that in 2013,India's ratio of 138police personnel per lakh ofpopulation was the fifth lowest among the 71 countries for which the agency collated these figures. (13 Jul 2018)

Source: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/indias-ratio-of-138-police-personnel-per-lakh-of-population-fifth-lowest-among-71-countries/articleshow/48264737.cms

There is just not enough police force to attend every citizen's grievances. Plus those are in police force are paid meagre salaries. So they rely on bribes. Plus the Political pressure from local corporater to MP in every case. The whole system is rotten to core. There is no point in expecting much from police in this banana republic.

Changes: Increase the workforce, reduce the workload. Make police more humane, public friendly. Give them psychology lessons as how to handle the complainant as well as situation. Political pressure needs to ward off. Police must not be tool of politicians. 

Let this all changes be in effect and then see if crimes against anyone reduce or not. This country is filled with vengeance but no rational though. Does this encounter improve safety for women longterm even medium? Nope.

But everyone is now happy with the encounter and will sleep with a false sense of security. Like the sheep they are. Everyday the society that lives inside this country keeps on deteriorating, everyday I say to myself "" you don't need to go abroad , india will progress"" and every night "" fuck this lets start planning"" Innocent until proven guilty. That's ""How to get away with murders"" or more accurately "" How to get away with five murders"" It's getting really scary to live in this country. My whole family was like "" Now that is justice. Well deserved. Great work police"" 

I was like ""But that's murder and straight out of a Bollywood movie.""

Obviously I did not say it out loud because then I am the bad guy What’s most worrying is how so many buffoons are celebrating this Kruttika is right I'm more heartbroken by the reaction of the common people than the cops. It's so disappointing to see, and not for the first time to be sure, how bloodthirsty and stupid most people are. Why are we like this? Why do we have lesser( maybe even <10% ) population who actually understands the flaw in the system and want it to be changed. Why are we outnumbered? The two things that any govt needs to deliver is

1. Strengthen and reform the police
2. Augment judiciary to delivery justice within proscribed time-frame

Today only decent folks are afraid of the police and avoid them like plague. Most govt. systems in India lack transparency or accountability.

While all theory is well and good, which politician will do things that undercut his levers of power.

Can't see a change on the horizon.. How people get confused. Because justice get delayed, because police do not prepare documentation expeditiously, not able to bring all the proofs etc.. but it is easy to make encounter and close everything and become hero, no n - no questions, no fingers. In one shot police ha solved problem of public, judiciary and biggest problem of their own. All are happy, how great our police! Rather than this kind of shit (which I think is a staple of every South Indian movie) why no look at the deeper problem. This clearly shows the frustration people have against justice department. There is also this deep seated superiority in males steming from our patriarchal society that has always done this. It is more like immune reconstitution syndrome where people have started raising their voices. One f*ing country... Similar to usa, but replace 3 with feared for his paedofile life. It's a disgrace.

Justice is only done if there is reward or public pressure.

Nobody seems to care about doing the right thing. This is beyond infuriating. I think applying anonymity like we do in medical case studies at some points can really make some difference in conviction rates of powerful. Just a shower thought. What about MP and MLA??  Why not outrage against MPs or MLAs.
BJP has most number of these rapist. Who will encounter. I am all in for capital punishment for rapists.

But what if these guys were framed and someone very powerful has something to do with the case and they were killed to close this case as soon as possible? And those who are against such tribal and mob justice are called 'rape apologists' by many right wingers on Twitter. Faye has spoke against it and some people like our very own Payal Rohatgi is saying ""Faye wants Hindu women to get raped blah blah blah"". Seriously, we might be living in 21st century but most of our minds are still in 18th century This Meme says it all ! Chalo, court ka kharcha bach gaya. ""The tragedy of violence is made even more unbearable by its glorification"" Amartya sen Totally off topic, but I love that show.  ""whatever happened in this case was absolutely right and this case is  different from all the other cases"". What's the last panel supposed yo mean? Dank you poliza vary cool. Please kill more peeps. Wanna get that fresh Nazi feel Such privilege for poor people...Jai hind?!! ""[The rapists are dead! Or are they?](https://inmiy.home.blog/2019/12/06/the-rapists-are-dead-or-are-they/)"" Do read this article and share it forward. People need to read and understand this otherwise the system will confuse us and then kill our fight our fight too, our fight for a better, educated and empowered society.

Please do not get diverted. **PLEASE** keep the protest alive. It’s okay if you are satisfied and happy with what happened today but it did not help our fight at all. Our fight is for a better, educated and secure society & that fight is nowhere near over yet. Justice loses its character if it becomes revenge the first two things are done by different police, last one different. you cannot say same things about good and bad cops Apparently the ‘wise’ man Sadhguru said , it was justice this time, but should not be repeated. I had to really push back on my spouse and ask her to think on her own and form her opinion independently.  Women do feel pretty intensely and I guess they are the one who are preyed on and bear the brunt of violence.. they might have a different take on it The cops incompetence is sky high.. Either that , or they blatantly and brazenly took things in their own hands. Non-heroes absolutely in either scenario.


We’ve seen this enacted graphically and convincingly in so many movies.. it’s surreal . The guns in the dead men’s hands .. lack of handcuffs.. them being not well built or physically in good shape at the time ( I’m sure) .. lastly our “sharpshooters” obviously couldn’t aim below the waist given the chaotic situation. Finally a desperate state of mind ( the cops minds) because : the murderers had destroyed all evidence/dna by burning the body - did the cops hopelessness ( at the prospect of a prolonged trial) cause them to shortcut things? 

On another line, I’m guessing they should have got the victim DNA from the perpetrators ( hair or body fluids or blood) ? Then you could tie that dna back . Do Indian trials use such DNA as evidence.?

AFAIK, even a simple robbery earns you a pair of handcuffs.. so there’s definitely a question with these perpetrators being India’s most wanted men ( in custody) . 


And one more thing,I would’ve thought they must be on suicide watch. The Delhi guys were , because they knew a mob was outside the jail baying for blood.

The last thing we need to see is these guys ( who were on the defensive last week) being feted with flowers Aaye...Dumb dibbo Do you know the legal processor, circumstances, importance of evidence and the number of times accused can reach higher courts and file re appeals?

And aren't you the same guys abusing establishment for crime against women? Do you fucking know the principal of fear? 

If you don't, Fuck off, talking about falsely accusing someone and this happening to them, its not this easy to file a rape case and going in trial with it, movie chal rhi h kya yahaan bc Literally this sums up the events that transpired! If the extra judicial killings have made your morality tend to herd mentality, you might be part of the problem. They should have gone full Jigsaw on them and torture the shit out of them

A bit dark... Ik r/nononoyes Rapists get killed.
Everyone: Happy
Liberals and hypocritical people and others still trying to blame their own people: it still a murder and those police officers must be jailed

Why don't political parties sign legal bonds with other parties when they make alliances rather than verbal agreements? Indian political parties act in an extremely amateur way, especially given the money they make. Because civil lawsuits in India are joke Bonds are not as much as effective as people believe. In fact the ticket that they get functions like a bond.

If some one change parties they have to resign their seats. They don't have to only if they split the party and form a new party. They must be made to sign smart contracts on Ethereum Why is no one buying BJP MLAs? How come only other party members jump the ship?

Politics,The way this advertisement make people aware of government scheme and subtly promote a political party at public expense,35,dxxaz2,https://i.redd.it/7rbm5yik2dz31.jpg,20,,sudden_dust," This issue was raised last year by only one channel as usual, NDTV, when even the ones who work for this scheme raised concern and not other news channel reported anything about it, so like every other issues which citizems should be aware of, this was also sweeped under the rug In delhi it's like 8 adverts of AAP(4 full page + 4 quarter) कहा बीजेपी का लिखा है बे जोपड़ी के It's normal.

Centre funded ambulances in punjab had 5 foot long photos of akali leaders even though they didn’t contribute shit... All said and done. These meds are actually good and price is brilliant. Branded Paracetamol cost 98rs for 10 tablet blister pack. In this scheme i got 10 such blister pa ks for 40rs so 4 rs/pack and the med list is quite exhaustive.

Politics,"With Maharashtra loss, the BJP, which once commanded over 71 per cent of India at the state level, has been reduced to just 40 per cent.",756,e27wnp,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bjp-india-saffron-map-2019-after-maharashtra-turmoil-1622837-2019-11-26,217,,sharjeelsayed," Mizoram doesn’t have BJP govt if I’m not mistaken. This is what happens when you pay more attention to Mandir than Money. None of this matters :( 
Had said the almost similar stuff when rajasthan, mp,and karnataka was wrestled from the bjp during elections. 
2019 came and modi wiped everyone out. I wouldn't be particularly elated. Keep in mind that in Maharashtra the BJP was only displaced by the SS, which has an even older history of hatemongering than the BJP. I fear that this is another step towards Hindu Pakistan, where the only opponents to Jihadi parties are other Jihadi parties.

Yes, in the short term, the tight slap on the face of our Hon'ble Home Minister feels veeeerrry satisfying, given his utterly cynical use of institutions to harass opponents. The reason is pretty simple. The state elections were won by the BJP in the name of Modi and they took it for granted. I'm from Rajasthan and it came as a shock when bjp won in 2014 in the state. The thing is congress (more like Gehlot) was doing a great job and even some bjp supporters wanted him to win. But he lost, then came Vasundhara. She delayed the phase 2 metro project citing the city doesn't need it. But the phase 2 was actually needed more than the phase 1. Reason being more traffic on that route. Also, it was the only way to get metro to make some profit, but she didn't do that. I'm actually not sure what she actually has done in her time as CM. It seems like people are starting to come to their senses now. You can't win the election in the name of a single person. The thing that pisses me off is that opposition parties still don't care about providing good governance and curving corruption. They are so blind its pathetic. They should remember that the same public thay threw them out in 2014 can do so again. After next elections I would like to have tea and pakora from Mr. Modi's Tea Stall I have seen this doing rounds over the last couple of days on social media. My personal political leanings aside, this chart is too stupid to be of any prominence.  As it stands today, the BJP are an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, increasingly close to being a majority in RS as well. In some parts of India, they have a good chance to come to power in the near future - like West Bengal and Delhi, and in many other states they are the single largest party despite not forming the government. They had lost the state elections before the Lok Sabha ones before as well. However, at a national scale there is a tremendous power vacuum and they use it to their own advantage.  Such charts provide cute relief to people like me who are thirsty for a positive spin to the situation. However, they are pretty dangerous and might give us a false sense of hope even as we move towards a pseudo dictatorship If you substract from this the states where they purchased majority or weaseled their way in via a pliable governer , ec, landing sea planes, or demonitization, they are probably at15℅. 

Can we have an Reddit party anyways? FeelsGoodMan but the fact is these states have bjp majority. still people are not giving clear fuck you to bjp in other states. andhra, telangana, Tamil nadu are the only states people said no to bjp Once modi goes bjp is basically dead...don't think shah eill have the same bhakt magnet capabilities Bottomline is second rung leaders in BJP are not big like modi, for all the talk about the Sangh developing leaders beyond Modi they don't really have a sure thing. They didn't help their cause by making every campaign about Modi. They will win parliamentary elections until he is the PM candidate. Hopefully they loose UP elections despite the temple. If it bleeds, you can kill it. 15 lakh bank me nahi aye kaka isliye har gaye 

Truth UP is next. Jharkhand can swing any side.
Only state to worry about is West Bengal now. I love this image bhartiya takloo party. 

modi, shah, adityanath, rajnath, jaitley, kovind ... all Modi leher It's amusing how people (except those who just didn't want to see BJP in power at any cost) are so relieved over Shiv Sena forming govt. instead of BJP as if they're a better alternative. Still the fascists and neolibs will run that state, so not such a big victory. Most of this is anti-incumbency in play and nothing else. I wish India had similar political dynamics 50 years ago. Do you really think that rss/bjp/modi are on the way out? Kind of misleading. They shouldn’t have counted parties which were in NDA. 

For example, you can’t call Andra a bjp state just because TDP were in NDA. 
BJP literally have no footprint in AP. People need to wake up before it’s too late when all we have is temples and statues I am not pro BJP in any way but I simply don't see a way out of this political turmoil. The horse trading, brain washing, fascist ideology is a trend that is becoming prevalent across the globe. It's not like if Indians do start to realize the extremist ideology being fostered by BJP they will have a better alternative to turn to. I feel the genuinely educated are becoming more disinterested in politics day by day.   


Assuming BJP doesn't come back in 2024 who do we turn to? Uplifting news. Bharatiya Janata are traditionally not Partiers, perhaps that is the issue here. Afaik, Bharatiya Janata are at heart extremely highly civilised and the best kind too, civic including decentralised agrarianistical so pat your self on the back bhais and didijis. The other aspect of Bharatiya Janata is dharma. The yuga-dharma as stated in the Upanishad is harinam sankirtan. Peaceful, musical, loving, non-discriminatory sankirtan of Harinaam. Free to participate. 
If hippies from the 1960s N.Y. bowery can become happies whom Bhagavan Himself has smiled upon, then just imagine if you Indian  gentlemen and ladies can somehow pull yourselves back together again for that, even after all this time."
Politics,Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,1596,e5rae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,355,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",rehnedeyaar," I am not an Indian, but I share and appreciate your passion about social issued. I met many India friends here at America. I learned from them  about Indian politics, religions and histories from time to time. 

I am amazed by how India hold itself together as the world's largest democratic country,  overcoming the sheer amount of the fractions or diversities within the the society. Dialects, religions, sub-caste systems, custums, to name a few.  This is quite an accomplishment in itself.

It's difficult to move forward in unison without a center of gravity holding different parts together.  Nationalism and tribalism are such examples, good or bad.

My question is this: in your opinion, what are other viable 'center of gravity' which could serve the purpose as unifying forces for society,  large or small? Just a curiousity. Thanks! You seem to come from a more traditional/conservative family OP. In mine, all of the forced feet touching, forced pooja attending, fake reverence for all elders died out a generation ago.

My father does it occasionally when he wants to, and my siblings and me never do it. 

In fact we are all atheists, and when elders make ridiculous Facebook or what's app based claims, we debunk them on the spot. 

It helps that most of my siblings and me are around 30 now and we are quite successful in our own fields. Indians does not wanna accept that our country is flawed and our customs are broken.

We can't fix it if we won't even admit that it's broken. VS Naipaul vividly described this effect as an “inability to see” - read “An Area of Darkness” for an articulate description of this syndrome. This fake superiority complex is one of the biggest problem of this country, which believes that the Indian/Desi style of doing things or the Desi culture is the only correct way. Anyone who has a differing opinion is shot down to shreds.

It is also really sad that **Super-Power by 2020**, a dream that Dr. Kalam held so preciously is now nothing but a meme material in the current socio-political scenario. We do. And only we could fix it. Our parents and older relatives are set in their ways and I don't see that changing. So the onus falls on us to fix it. I suppose, once you settle into the bowels of any society, all that remains are problems, maybe of varying degrees, but problems nonetheless and that is not necessarily bad, perhaps life lies in the battle itself, "" ONE makes the many, hence ONE cannot be NONE"" so I gues it's not about being passive and Optimistic, but more like a pessimism of strength a kind that makes you aware but not hopeless but leads to be a more active participant into the profession you choose to serve society and the personality and beliefs you offer to your peers and the coming generation. Keep ranting to everyone you know in real life. Most will think you're spoilt, but a few will realize they're being idiots following other idiots rather than figuring things out for themselves. Change comes gradually if you try, and not at all if you don't. I have found a formula to short circuit all this bullshit. Does the elder person in point pays your bills or makes your life easier in any way? If yes, go ahead and show some respect. If not, say hi and move on.

I have had enough bad experiences with so called relatives (including breaking my relationship apart) that I give zero fucks if I lose a shred of contact with them. Your parents will eventually understand your position. 

I always say to my parents that those ‘chaar log’ have destroyed dreams of god knows how many children in this country. Take care of yourself first. Because your relatives will always take care of their children first, even if their children go against the very culture that the relatives are forcing on you (they would celebrate and even brag about their children working/studying in a foreign country, but will choke the ‘culture’ down your throats if you decide to do the same)

Fuck’em. I broadly agree with you on this, but one shouldn't really be dismissive of others' wisdom and experience. The Indian education system has been a major screw up, but this has got to do with a lot more. From a bird's eye perspective, I see a sheer lack of organizational skills among Indians as a group. One can't really count on the Indian execution of tasks. There tends to be a systematic lack of discipline in most sectors. But there's another way of looking at it. India wasn't an industrialized nation in the 19th century. Even to this day, India is an agrarian economy. During and forth proto-industrialization era, labour had become more organized due to added machinery, and so forth. India on the other hand, being a agro-based country missed the bus, to discipline-land and development-land. Lot of it boils down to our culture. Interacting with people from other countries made me realize that many of them don’t know about the wrong ways of doing things. That felt weird but makes so much sense. Amazing. I too, as someone who lives in the US, but travels to India for short periods every 6 months or so, feels the exact same way! Most native Indians have no idea for what is going on in their country. Poverty, homelessness, and mental illnesses have always been a extreme issue, not forgetting to mention greed in the government, and pollution in the air. Instead, Indians are focused on what clothes they will be wearing the next morning, or what an aunty that, as you said “doesn’t give a flying fuck about me” thinks.  Really saddening. Hopefully India will wake up to this one day 👍 Maaaannn
You speak my mind
Literally everything you said I wanted to speak this from a long timeeeee.
everything you said is soo truee. Society progresses one funeral at a time.

We gotta go through a lot of funerals. Dude, if possible, you should contribute to sociology. If this hypothesis becomes known worldwide, there will be pressure to reform. I relate,I'm just 17 right now but as I've grown older I've felt more and more unfortunate about being born here and not in the US like most of my cousins,I know that's a horribly futile line of thinking but that's what I think sadly,and both of the times that I went there to stay for 2 months I was completely repulsed at having to come back. I've just lost faith that this place can improve,and it only took a newspaper habit and some common sense. I'm not sure if I wanna call myself an atheist, right now I'm just way too busy with compounds containing oxygen to go about figuring my spiritual leanings,but mom just openly saying in front of my aunts and uncles ""do namaskar"" in a reprimanding tone for not doing it already is incredibly annoying,not to mention them saying ""no no no don't"" once I go for it,like just shut the fuck up and take this token of respect please. The relatives that I do love and respect already know I do,and don't make such a big deal of these things. 

All in all I'm happy you're someplace better (do say where, if you can) and I hope to do something similar too (and so does my mom,she's already taking about 3 of my uncle's being American citizens will help me out even though I'm not gonna get out till my bachelor's is over). OP, if you can, please respond, I share the same sentiments, all the bullshit is necessary in this country other than the real shit, you got children dying of hunger and food fed to the cows, people die in winters, cause they are homeless and ain't got no clothes, mental health is a fucking taboo, if you even say the name of a mental illness, you'll be an outcast, if you're got to take psychology or psychiatry, you must be either crazy or you'll go crazy working around mad men, I mean Thomas had never seen such fucking batshit ever before, and oh yeah, instead of focusing on the fucking economy, let's make another big ass statue at the ram mandir, and did I forget to tell you, don't eat meat on Tues fucking day. The isolationalism from others you mentioned eventually became the downfall of Indian society. Traders were not trusted because they interacted with others and Boom, others, due to cooperation with each other became better. See I get your point. I also used to feel like this that we should change, our country isn't self aware, our parents are delusional etc. But the thing is we can't change anything quickly. It takes time and no amount of rant will make this country better only you will go insane day by day. Some people use this excuse to justify their in-competence, hell they do not have their shit figured out and they *wanna change the world*. 
I think we should learn from Newton just do our job peacefully and I'm not saying exactly like him, just try to be genuine humble and honest and hopefully if not the country at least our future families will be more sane because we will be a part of it. Thank you for reading. D A I L Y


I H A T E I N D I A



T H R E A D Oh look at this guy! 

Lived a few years in a foreign country and already pretending to be a firangi! How can you understand us Indians now? You have lost all culture and can see only faults in us. Shame on you for blaming our respected elders who give us their valuable experience and gift of passing down a rich culture and heritage. /S Insecurity masked as a superiority complex. Not based on anything really. Reason why we don't qualify for the FIFA world cup even with well over a billion people and Michael Phelps has more Gold Medals than all of India combined. We sit there proud of fuck all while patting ourselves on our backs and concerning ourselves with only truly regressive backward shit like religion, caste and hatred for Muslims. India is a shithole and it's not getting better at least in your life time so if you want to live a quality life, get the hell out and leave it to the Bhakts, Unkills and losers that couldn't get out. For god's sake, stop judging Indian culture and its rituals with the parameters derived from western cultures. You belong to family with conservative background and it surely does not symbologies the entire country. Stop thinking that being conservative about our own culture is sign of backwardness. 

For the another point that you have mentioned about how indians don't care about their own people, we are one of the most family oriented cultures in the world. Out both major political parties are economically liberal. Government funded education system and health systems provide enough proof for that. West don't care about their subjects more than their eastern counter parts. It just doesn't visible due to their prosperity. In India, despite major government subsidies for deprived, due to large numbers, poverty rate is still noticable. Well put, I thought I was the only person who thought like this. I wish if there was some device which teleport billions of Indians(DOA) and kept 1000 selected people who write new laws, abolish all unwanted riti-riwaz etc and just work for building a new India and making it a lot better... 

Or maybe in the near future when resources are close to depletion, there will be habitable planets discovered where selected individuals will be given billions and trillions of fund to develop their country etc or something 

🤞🏻 Most of this resonates to what I’ve been thinking lately and when I scroll to the comments, I realise how real the far right propaganda is and how much it has affected fence sitters Everything starts and ends at EDUCATION.  
IMO the current Indian society is a result of the most lethal societal combination possible:  
Population density (There are hell a lot of people everywhere)   
\+  
Extremely low literacy rate (Most of that population is uneducated -  trapped in a centuries old mind set)   
\+  
Democracy (Everyone has a right to speak and be heard. Which is good, but in this case the majority of voices are uneducated and iron headed)

These 3 things combined are lethal for India as a society, a republic and a country. As long as we don't control the first two components. And according to me proper modernized Education is the only way out (Mind it, it will still take at least a decade to start affecting the society). There will still be a right to speak but the voices heard would be far more sensible and constructive. [removed] Definately not a shit hole country ""Ours is a field which respects innovation and not tradition"" - Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO.

We live in a technology world. Unpopular Opinion (here) warning: 

Culture, cultural identity and image are **also** important and preserving it is not a issue any more or less worthy than healthcare or education.

Without shared identity we would revert to a cluster of warring tribes hunting and gathering. Why will a Khatri pay the tax a Srivastava will use, if both didn't share the Indian identity and culture ?

If there is no society, no judiciary, no healthcare, what will you improve ?

Also delve more into whatever country that you've migrated to's history. You will see culture preservation has been part and parcel of development, particularly during the nationalism movements. Stop painting all Indians with the same brush

Just because your parents were conservative doesn't mean all Indians are

My parents are liberal atheists who never forced any 'tradition' upon me

Just because I had a liberal childhood doesn't mean I go on having this rosey eyed view that India is liberal


Same way you try to say India is a conservative nation

It's a melting pot with people of all views i heared we have now a new country, some place called kelasa or something, we can shift there its broucher seems promising. I am sick of people trying to make these issues ""Indian"" where as these are universal. Any country large enough to be more populous than a city has shady practices. Not saying hello to a remotely related aunt has gotten my American friends in trouble too. Don't dump your escapist insecurities onto us under the pretext of how it is all Indians and India that is the problem. 
There are hypocrites everywhere. There are cultural annoyances everywhere. You are too busy hating to realize that. I am not saying India has no problems. It does. But we are no different than any other country or countrymen out there. Population>low literacy rate> Poverty this is the vicious cycle india needs to fix right away if we want a better future. We should not only know our rights but also  know  our responsibilities. None of the listed ‘problems’ look like ‘real problem’ to me, honestly. I don’t think these are what matters in the long term for a country.

You started with education. So I thought you were trying to list flaws in the education system and so on, which would have been fine. But you ended up listing ‘your problems’ more than what India as a nation needs to be more concerned about.

Just my opinion. Ah the woes of a upper caste indian. A very conservative family and also went abroad for studies? That means rich too. This isn't that common. The problem lies with the leaders, since being a good and intellectual leader with power  can bring forth progressiveness and change faster than a legion of like minded people . I am not underestimating the mass, I am just saying/texting, some people have unintellectual idols and follow dellusioned leaders into a war that is for the sake of the leader and it's ideologies.  
India can go toe to toe with the developed nations, we just lack good progressive  leaders on a major scale. First of all I feel really sorry for you, living in such a ""traditional"" family is really hard if you have more than one brain cell up there. I agree with pretty much everything that you said. I really want to support my fellow citizens but I do see widespread jealousy, superiority complex, inability to take ""No"" for an answer especially in our elders. And the way we believe in religion is really different from how a religious person should be. From listening to the priests all the time no matter how many absurd things they say to marry a women you don't know any better than a stranger but hey your astrology matches up so it must be a perfect match! Sorry for my own little rant but I just want to say that I feel you even though my family is bearable and I express my opinions freely and don't give a fuck about what others will have to say about it. Instead of coming up as a weird outlier, I've actually motivated my cousins to think about all the stuff lol and looks like they have started questioning their parents too so that was a good thing. If possible try to extend your time in Europe, you've not written about your experience in Europe but I'm pretty sure it would be better than India!

Ps: Most of my friends in our generation is really cool so I think our next generation would be way much better (at least in urban areas) than ours! let me rearrange the sentence everything matters except the people. superpower 2020 but all of this happens I am the only one feeling that the op is over generalizing . I am born to poor not so educated parents , they were 20 at the time I was born , so I have seen them growing with me , infact all my relatives share the same story . I mean more then half of my close relatives , not so close relatives have come out of poverty in just these two decades and along with it they have become really mature people especially men and children's , all this without any western influence because all of the elders in my family are from hindi medium , do not have any inferiority complex about our culture , and did not watch much bollywood and tv serials , everything they learned is through their life experience and the women in my family were all house wives so they did not have much exposure to the world but they have also became better because they now have a better life . I am sure this the story of many indians , but the present generation is always complaining about how we are inferior to the west . We don't need to be like west to succeed as a nation , rather we should evolve our culture and society in a way that is comfortable for us rather then copying west . West and indian subcontinent should not even be compared because we are so different culturally as well as in terms of development we are far behind , and the west have more of a leadership approach whereas indians prefer following others for example :- adopting western culture . So we cannot be a leader by following a leader we can be a leader by competing with the leader like what china is doing. Well put OP. The children drink the ""riti riwaz"" ghutti from birth and hence the whole society gets stuck up. I have seen some interesting samples too. Where in western europe are you? > but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner .

Satyavachan. To get out of India you have to be successful in being a part of the system here. Don't ever let it be known you want out, just get out quietly when the chance comes; or you're stuck here forever. You spoke what I have always felt. There is patriotism in India but it is very minimal. There is also no nationalism. There is only chauvinism. We don't believe we are better than the others, we believe we are better and everyone else is pathetic and only our great ""culture"" (I hate that word) is good and everyone else's is shit. 

As far as unkills are concerned, these pathetic losers have drunk the cool-aid of ""sanskari superpowa"". They believe that our sanskaar is going to save us from climate change and other issues. Rapes? They won't say it to your face (some might, cause you never know) but they will hint that the rapes are punishment and a lesson for the ""azaad"" ladki. 

India will only progress when such people get eradicated. > The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person! 

That is the part I hate the most. We are the ones who try to think openly and are made to feel we are wrong. 

It is true India is a mess, I don't think it's really better anywhere else though. Societies worldwide are a rotten mess. There is a positive side too but the truth still is it can be very harsh for many people. Man, this. Exactly this. I've been living in Western Europe as well for the past couple years, and you've managed to put in words exactly what I've been thinking.

I'd give you gold if I wasn't a poor student, lol. PM if you want to share rants. You have some valid points. However, remember that the vast majority did not experience an alternate way if life unlike you. They just keep living life as they see it.

People like you have to good fortune to go out and see what is going on else where and have a diverse view point. Change Will happen slowly and it is people like us who have this experience to ensure change.... One person at a time. Atheism should unite us. I feel you man. The kind of ignorance that there is here, coupled with all this nonsense notions of culture, traditions, etc is just depressing. I open the newspaper and it's always filled with shit things these politicians say, the shit things they do, and the way people ignore the really important matter and get swayed by distractions (Pakistan, Hindu Musalman and what not).

GDP is falling, no one cares. Public universities are being trampled, no one cares. We might run into a recession soon, no one cares. RTI is just a namesake now, no one cares. Govt can now declare anyone a terrorist without a trial, no one cares. Electoral bond has been introduced, most people don't even know. Lekin mandir yahi banega. 

There is fear of standing against the govt now as Rahul Bajaj said a few days back. These people would not even agree that there is a problem. They will change the formula for GDP again or make claims like millenials are preferring Ola, Uber and hence the slowdown. Most of the media today is so biased, they would not even criticize, and would talk about Modiji k 56 inch ka seena and all. 

I am planning to go abroad for my future studies in a year, and when I think about it, I don't know why I should come back. I understand your frustration. We're the generation brought up by ~~Hollywood~~ western values and it's hard to understand where this orthodoxy comes from. Not everyone has had the same exposure that we did.  
We're a young country, and we have so many challenges to overcome. The main being the non-homogeneity in society - both in terms of culture and wealth distribution.   
The educated middle and upper class can *afford* to be liberal, because you and I don't care what the 'stupid society' thinks of us. For those who depend on their communities to provide social security cannot afford to alienate said communities might find it safer to be part of the herd.  
Maybe it's a bit snobbish of me to think so, but you cannot expect the people to be progressive/ intellectual when they don't even have assurance of food, shelter and personal safety. You cannot ask people to reflect upon the antiquity of our rituals when their priorities in life are, justifiably, something else entirely.   
The more developed the country becomes, more of us are going to dismiss organised religion and rituals. But yes, these are also part of what the roadblocks to development are. You sir are spitting up straight facts I feel you bro....everything that you have said in the post is 100% correct because it happens daily in a indians life...if i don't listen to my parents or my relatives then they look at my like i am India's most wanted criminal....many times i don't agree with their opinion and they have just one dialogue  to say to me that i have lost all of my values and i don't respect the elders blah blah....i say to them that difference of opinion doesn't mean that i am against them but they won't listen....from childhood we're taught to behave because society will judge us and not welcome us if we did something against the norm...but where are we going as a society as a nation we must first think of that Off topic: How did you get to be an exchange student? How can I do the same for my kid? Does it cost an arm and a leg? Civic sense. Jab tak common civic sense nahi ayega tab tak ye problems rahengi. We will be the next parents of India. The change has to come with us now. This ""shared delusion"" I think is part of living in any society nowadays, probably some are more ""delusional"" than others. Aasirwad is working , so shut up OP . This post basically sums up how different Indians are vis a vis others. The point about respecting elders is so true. Ideally we should respect everyone and I return we get respected back. Age is no criterion to decide who gets the respect. Ironically it has been found that a certain uncle(respected) has actually been abusing young boys and girls behind everyone's back, and think of this that you are made to stand in front of him with folded hands. 
Secondly the extreme chauvinistic attitude that we are mahan, better than everyone. Trust me there is so much we can learn from western people especially about basic human morality. Ops point about wedding events in India and poor people crowding for leftovers is so true, we should be ashamed of ourselves. There is no harm in learning from others.
Last but not the least forget everything of real importance and bash Pakistan up for each and everything, gloat over every propoganda fed to us on WhatsApp. Am an NRI didn't know this is how shit is there. Damn >I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

This is what fears me the most. **It probably never will.** Indian culture looks down on individuality.....that is supposed to be reserved for the super rich.....the rest are expected to know their place.

If you want to live in India keeping your individuality intact, learn to cut off contact with overbearing relatives and never attend group gatherings where such retardness festers. I agree with everything you just said. The truth is, the generation in power doesn't see the rationality our generation does. They are more worried if the leaders of the ancient past rather than working on real issues in the present. The society is still run by narcissistic bigots who think that their way is the correct way, they simply don't see the need for change. The government sees every free and liberal space as a void to be filled with a suffocating vacuum of power and control. 





Even if we cut some slack to the uneducated masses who have grown up in an environment of depravity and oppression where they were crushed into boulders of misery by the agonizing wheel of injustice for not seeing the stark reality of this boiling mess of a country, the educated ones are no better either. It is surprising to see how much of absolute idiots these so called ""upper-middle class"" educated Indians are. 




This country is full of Karens with an engineering degree, working as the manager of the restaurant while catalysing their own destruction by actively taking part in it. It is a rant or some stereotyping bullshit. He is just generalizing the shitty environment that has been part of his life. I am not sure how they relate.  Let me agree agree with you that ours is a society that is not concerned with real issues.  But how does touching elder's feet or putting a tikka causing that?

Regarding the nihilistic part, for a few weeks pretend you are Japanese/American/Brazilian/Russian/British/French/Kenyan/Zimbabwean/bangladeshi/Pakistani and foolow their news.  You would feel the same about them after 5 months.  Because the news is always contemporary.  We have gone forward from where we started.  Not wholly or substantially, but in good measure. Yaar in rants ke neeche 4-5 keywords daal diya karo, tldr ki bhi zaroorat nahi hai. >real issues

You mean finding a solution to birth, death, old age and disease? Cultural arrogance is a disease our country has had even before the British raj..

We have become mindless sheep who just follow majority led cultural systems because that's what we are taught..

A major marker of narsissistic personality disorder is inability to self assess.. Of course no body wants to examine how much damage we do as Indians because then we can't brag about being an ancient and wise country. Because following and adhering to culture is all we have been taught, not following it would be self distructive. Even though we all know how much screwed it makes us..  

>Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.

True

I feel like a lot of what you said came from shitty religious ""rules""

Which is why I gave up all religion, gladly my parents were supportive (15) Well said. I honestly think one of the biggest problem with India is that we want someone else change things for us rather than doing it ourselves. All the examples you have given above is completely true and valid and I myself have thought about it so many times. About why we still see India as a developing and not a developed country. I guess the textbook solution is doing our part for change. Because trust me we can't say there is no awareness. And even though it might sound as stupid as it sounds we as the young generation need to start working on these thoughts and actually do something .  The only way it's gonna progress is by doing our part. Could you please tell more about the differences you felt in the education system?Curious to know That is absolutely beautiful...I know beautiful should not be the right response but the way OP has structured his rant, tells me that there is still some hope left in this country. People like OP are the reason shit hasn't hit the fan yet. 

Hope is always beautiful. 

I am gonna make PDF of this..keep it safe till my kids grow up and make them read this... There's no solution for this my man. The old narcissist fucks own everything in India. The new educated generation has nothing to work with, they work under those stupid people. Need a Tl;DR Agree with OP I feel you. You said everything I think very eloquently. 
My hope for the future is our generation of better educated adults will help reset this mentality a little bit as the unkil generation slowly lets go of the reins of society. Very well said mate, I agree with you completely. The mentality of the average person here leaves a lot to be desired. Most don't even posses basic civic sense, let alone any other form of decency. Narcissism is highly prevailant especially wrt a near communist style of national pride. This country has eons to go, a very long way indeed. Yet only us deshdrohi log seem to realize that, the faithful believe that India is at the forefront. They won't even acknowledge how poor our recent GDP figures are. Friend, I hear you. This too shall pass. People with sick mentality breed in India, Trying to preserve our Indian culture , Our culture consisted of Kamasutra yet sex is tabooed subject in our society might as well wear loin cloth and sit flutes in our hand just like our ancestors did ! Pathetic place grown up in .... Preach brother! 🙌🙌 The spread of social media to the general population with cheap internet and mobile phones causing the spread of propaganda and a lot of misinformation. As the op mentioned ideologies of whats app university and Facebook patashala are spreading with bull shit. Twitter is another hole where it's like trolls,bakths Vs general population >you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society

Doesn't almost every country do something like that. It's just a part of feeling some national pride. Although very incorrect, it is acceptable to say like thought. 

What is sad though... despite our country producing the top scientists, doctors, engineers and whatnot we still live under constant blanket of superstition and religious misinformation that clouds our judgement. The education is lacking in our behaviour and the decisions we make. Unfortunately, we have to wait a few generations for something drastic to happen > how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids....you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens!


Easy: It's in almost EVERY Indians psyche/mental DNA to just not see it.
Several foreign authors (eg P. Theroux) who have travelled in India wrote about this.

You can see this just by reading comments in certain discussions ([like right in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/f9m0myj/) ) in this subreddit. It's easy to spot them because randians are more or less the top n % of Indian society. India is my country. I am not proud of it. :( >Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about;

that hit close to home. Yeah All 130 crore of us all exactly the same....good stuff you are learning in your nice ""Western European education system"". 
Far left is as bad and toxic as far right.  [http://www.quickmeme.com/img/4e/4e6da28748b4f3026cfa840d38b168c1d8afa03b72fb10606238c2ac2591a147.jpg](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/4e/4e6da28748b4f3026cfa840d38b168c1d8afa03b72fb10606238c2ac2591a147.jpg) For me, personally, it is the education system that has killed me. Symbolic Marks are more important than real education. I hope God saves us. As an international student who studied in the US for 9 years and came back to India, it honestly seems that the eventual goal of people is to set up their family so that one day one generation of kids can go and study abroad and settle there. I met so many Indians in the US who left India obviously to obtain a better life but would constantly fantasize about India. Rose-tinted glasses I suppose... I don't know more about India but I can say people around me are nice. Some people are bad, they have habit to backbiting and extremist and racist. They only support people of their caste. 

But overall
People are nice. I don't see this happening after a few years. Things are changing, at least here in Mumbai. Actually they changed a long while ago and times are only getting better Just wanted to say that I'm really impressed about the English level and discussion culture in this thread.

I have work related contact to Indian ""Coworkers"" every day and, sorry about that, it makes me think about ending my fucking life almost every time."

In the words of great trey parker and matt stone:-

""Pussies don't like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes that just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck a asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate. And it takes a pussy to show them that.

He even used to root for Modi on facebook in early 2014 (those days when BJP was still struggling for power!).

However, the lower rung of employees in development, testing, etc. weren't that outspoken about their political inclination. But on the few occasions that they did, I gathered that they were either centrists or leftists. They still did support Modi at that time sure (considering that scams like 2G and Coalgate had taken the attention of entire nation!).

What is your observation regarding this? What does the average youth of our country think now?",ubuntu_mate," There is no room for heated debates or chest thumping in office. Its mostly confined to whatsapp message, status updates etc ! thats the reason ; BJP IT cell focus so much on creating digital friendly content. 

but , if someone brings up political topic or a jibe at BJP,Congress or regional party during a company event like team dinner, outing etc ! 

the RW is the first one to put forth the opinion in favour of BJP..

 most of times, AAP guy will counter it. 

The congress supporter will just stare and smile at the conversation

the left wing will think, its below their intellectual level to discuss these things when company is paying them to enjoy event.. 

after some amount of time is spent on discussion, everyone is back to discussing movies, web series etc Fk democracy am a pirate now Not sure if you meant internal office politics which kind of shadows today's discriminatory politics with rampant casteism and regionalism.

The outlook towards national politics differ amongst the employees. Some are left leaning like me(though very few) and some are outspoken right wingers, and a majority of workforce is latent right wingers(as in they don't understand their own politics that well but always found standing with the RW).

And if you look at the top level, I wouldn't say they're RW or LW, they simply happen to go with the establishment. Since they want their SEZs and tax cuts(which both Congress and BJP has been providing them with)

My personal take is that politics everywhere mirrors the national politics of india, which has been a constant since 1947: exploit the weak. bjp reduced our rights with dilution of rti, adhaar and censorship by jio and their biggest crime electroler bond which legalize bribery for politicians but they also better handling our forgien policy and actually completing promises they made before election so i will be happy if they  can revive our economy and remove electoral bond. I was a Congress supporter until Modiji came to power. I don't know there is some charisma about this man. Also, Congress has lost its credibility. Modiji at least make us feel that he is serious about our nation."

Has to be, since majority of the electoral bonds were donated, **anonymously**, to the BJP

Electoral bonds are open scams running the political system of the country. It needs to be fixed. We have absolutely no idea where the money comes from, no paper trail, nothing whatsoever

Once the electoral bonds issue is fixed, we can see some normalization of financial activities in the top political parties. The least is we should know who the top donors are.

Things will only be better if the money flow into the party is controlled/regulated So this is where rafale money went.

Keep in mind this is only the official amount. Only ~~God~~ mota bhai knows how much money they have in offshore banks. The longer Indians remain uneducated, Illiterate and stupid, the more bigger BJP will get. They have caught our nature of silence and cowardice.  They know we are ""God Fearing"" people.

I have had few horrid experience when i lived in Delhi as a child, i can dismiss other children's behavior towards me but Adults calling me madrasi (even though im not from Chennai) and an Aunty shouting at me to talk in Hindi in the park was just barbaric, good on that aunty i can speak 6 languages while she can speak only Hindi. God help those people Another statement to distract people through creating outrage on a topic that should be non debatable. 
This is why politicians are a curse . Divide and rule. Sigh, its like BJP has decided to learn nothing from history. Lets make all the same mistakes again and blame others for the mess.

A large cause of discontent in Bangladesh( then East Pakistan ) was due to Urdu imposition over Bengali speaking natives.

Tamil unrest in Sri Lanka also had roots in Sinhalese imposition. 

Hell, even South India saw a lot  of protest back in 60s when same stuff was said by a different group of ignorant leaders.

You can criticize Nehru however much you want but he did manage to create a united country despite all the differences and having nothing in common. These clowns are dismantling it one by one. 

Imagine if Modi and Amit Shah were in charge instead of Nehru and Patel. Their undemocratic and heavy handed way of bulldozing over people's opinion would have ensured balkanization of India. Can barely keep a united country together, I don't see them stitching together one. Actually its English which unifies India. India was always a diverse country. That was and is the beauty of this country. But our dear government is really suffering from tunnel vision, only choose to see hindutva, hindi, that's it, that is their only concern.  You can't force people to do shit. If you do they are gonna push back. This is *despite* BJP winning ZERO seats in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala in May this year. 

Yep, BJP really knows how to woo Southern states. All Hindi belt Bhakts will be fapping vigorously now Hindi is pushed by BJP government because of the assumption that native Hindi speakers are too dumb, too stupid & too lazy to learn English or other Indian languages.

The fact that many native hindi speakers are illiterate kinda validates the argument. Alas, other Indians are being made to suffer because of this :-( Just because we have more Dog population than tigers, we can't call it as National Animal. There's a quote from House of Cards which BJP has stuck to brilliantly:


""When you’re fresh meat, kill and throw them something fresher.""

As if Economy, J&K and NE issues are not enough Hindi is the national language of which Nation?

imagiNATION :-) MOTA SALA unifying India right! After religion now language seems like their new weapon to divide the country. If they do try and enforce is you can say good bye to the whole of south India and then some. People are really passionate about their mother tongue And people shat on me when I called the new Kerala Governor a Sarkari Muslim

https://twitter.com/KeralaGovernor/status/1172819142862225408?s=19 Bitch, if classes were provided for free, I'll learn Klingon, High Valyrian, Mandarin Chinese, Swahili, everything! Why stop at Hindi? He said Hindi, the nation is already divided. How dafaq is he going to unify.
This is just another tactics to divert economic problems. Everyone knows it is not possible to make every indian speak hindi (even if those guys give a personal BJ to non hindi speakers) But what about the economic slowdown? - Some sane person somewhere hopefully me Maharashtrat Marathi nahi tar kaay Hindi Bolu. Chutiya jhala ka, Taklya?? When you thought they were going to stop after Kashmir. As a South Indian from Kerala/Karnataka/TN, I'm very worried what he'll try to do in Southern India, especially in Kerala, which is 50% non-Hindu. Moreover, Tamil Nadu has had seccessionist tendencies in the past over Hindi. I hope that he'll leave the South alone with languages. I remember what happened last time someone tried to force a language.... [deleted] [deleted] He knows what he's doing. Now people forget the real problems and argue about this useless topic. The guy is trying to pull a covfefe and we'll just fall for it. Fuck Hindi imposition and fuck BJP The word India comes from the same root as Hindi, from the Indus River. Yes it is Hindi with the H silent. It is totally wrong to politicos 'Hindi ', though it helps to unified us but yet imposing Hindi on non-hindi speaker is condemnable. F.U.C.K.  O.F.F. As a South Indian, I totally get the worry of every other South Indian of Hindi imposition, when we are already struggling to keep the regional languages alive. 

Inspite of of this I have a slightly different take. I think we can make Hindi compulsory as a third language till 7th standard, so that everyone will know basic Hindi. See most of the people already study Hindi as their third language in South India. At least I did. So it won't change anything. And majority of people learning Hindi will definitely help in easier movement of people around India. 

If majority people oppose making Hindi compulsory third language, may be they could bring some programs to promote people to learn Hindi. I don't have problem with learning one extra language, but government should make every effort to protect the regional languages. 

It goes without saying people who settle in other states for longer periods should also respect the regional language and culture and make an effort to learn them. The people from that state should also make an effort to teach the outsiders their language and culture.

Lastly the government at any cost should not give a national language status to Hindi. We are famous in the world because of our diversity and We already have an unifying identity - ""We are Indians"". People from his own state hate Hindi. The way gujjus are making akshardham in every city of India, amit  shah would soon forget hindi and call for united gujju land. Good move."

Politics pe vishwash hi nahi raha modi bhakt here still gotta say Bjp is very poory managing the economy :/ The issue with economy will stay until this government can come up with their own policy and stand firmly by it. Unfortunately, all ""reforms"" have been reactionary and any steps announced in the budget were taken back at the mere scent of a disruption (say for example corporate taxes that were reduced significantly were actually meant to be increased). All measures the govt is taking are well intended but the BJP can't stand any loss in popularity and negative sentiment in populace. 

Also BJP doesn't have any economic policy of their own, the only thing they have known is finding faults in policies of previous regimes and so the govt is clueless. aaho ji bolo tararara https://twitter.com/anandj_/status/1200443606441635842 Hahahaha A girl and boy together does not mean they're in a relationship, they could be destroying the economy also. (stolen from a meme) [removed] Its a low blow you know...

I am a Hindu and I have no objection to temples being built. Modi Government is incapable of getting hold of economy but doesn't mean temples are responsible for that.

With this sort of rhetoric against Hindu religion, It will push new generation away from Hinduism leaving them disoriented, lost.

Edit: Pouring downvotes, but Sorry, I still believe, Temples are literally made culprit here. 

Mock the Government as much you like, why bring temples in between.

If Any 17 year old naive young person (which is rather our future), Just imagine what would this image imprint on mind, ""Government promotes Temples, Temples are bad, religion is bad. Hinduism is bad.""... I hope you are getting what I am trying to say....

You keep mocking Hinduism, Our traditions and BJP who attract masses on these topics will be keep on getting elected. Instead respect the religious sentiment of majority and win their hearts. There are number of ways to prove Modi wrong but this is not the one, definitely not by hurting their religious sentiments. Till yesterday, when GDP was going up everyone like these are just numbers nothing else when today GDP is going down suddenly GDP has become everything. Viral fuddu? Congress minded 🙃 Chutiya saala.

Politics,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,2347,e69fln,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e69fln/possible_scam_on_the_huge_youtube_tech_channel/,322,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today. 
https://imgur.com/a/7VJhBfP 

Thank you so much r/india for all the support in making this happen. All your comments here and on Twitter(and on YouTube too) made it possible for me to finally get the phone. Proud of the community. Thank you :)",javapyscript," I see no spam. I would have replied the same way if I had won a phone. He is ignoring you. And I think he doesn’t deserve that kind of attitude, just another desi YouTubeR who thinks he is a big shot. Update:

I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care much about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks [r/india](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/). He is asking me to delete my reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous I used to know him. While I was new to twitter, he also had just started the account in 2009ish. We used to talk. Later he kept SPAMMING all his friends and followers with his links and blogs and asked us to retweet them. I never retweeted this, and so he stopped following me. Also, my follower count was low and he didn't like to follow people with low follower counts. Typical Indian youtuber who has got his head pretty far up his backside. This guy and technicalguriji are probably the most biggest pricks of Indian YouTube. 

OP, this is not a scam exactly as you have not lost anything (other than some time and emotional distress). Even most giveaways outside have terms and conditions to give them excuses for not doing giveaways. 

If you really want revenge you need to spam his comments section and Twitter/IG. Most people follow such channels in the hope of winning a giveaway and fake promises will lose him subs and views.

I'm posting on most recent videos about this. I hate that guy as much as you. Send this to Neon Man -Youtuber.

I think he will post this odreal on his channel. Name and shame him.. Assholes stoop so low for likes. And then don't honor their word.

Tweet and share link here. We'll retweet and like. A marketer with 200,000 followers on Twitter is a guy who makes shitloads of money and if he can't send a phone he promised on time, just talks about his ethics overall. If he keeps this up, he's going to have Karma catch up with him before long. Do not delete this post. These Youtubers are biggest beggars. They want people to subscribe and like their shit. They use click bait titles and fool people. Then they come up with low quality ""Merch"" And expect people to buy their shit. 

They do these giveaways for more engagement and views. They earn a buck on peoples back but backtrack like this. 

Name and Shame such greedy bastards.

Another youtuber I hate is that money hungry UIC. There is facebook group named DeviceBar in which he is often active and lot of influencial people are there. You can post there if you want to call him out. Don’t pull down this post. Teach this asshole a lesson Expected from an Indian YouTuber. They have such scams running to increase their subscribers.

Some of them are really good but rest just read specs. The one on the top of the chain is the biggest scam of all. You can crosspost this to r/android or r/youtube. Would reach an even bigger audience. Let's report his channel on YouTube guys. That's the least we can do for our brethren. Simple fact man, most of us don't bother to keep contacting them after a certain amount of time. So, it's a win for the YT channel. They could keep the device/sell it away some place. Good that you kept pestering them. Honestly, didn't expect this from Amit. If guruji had done it, id say yes, he is a crook. But Amit, don't know man. Also gonna report this channel. Let's show them what they get for fucking around with general public. OP link his particular video here, which he released stating the giveaway.

The least I can do is report these idiots. Tweet everything out. Tag all the Indian tech YouTubers It's a good thing you posted this on reddit or you may never have got the phone at all. To think you got the congratulatory message that you won the phone on August 12th, and it is almost 4 months later after so much follow ups that you got the phone speaks for itself. Darn, 4 months is enough time for tech to get outdated even!   


The PR team for PhoneRadar was just doing damage control by finally sending you the phone! If the guy was ethical, he would've ensured you got the phone on the second follow up - not having time is a crappy excuse especially if you have a team - even CEOs of Fortune 500 firms act faster! So now the guy has deleted his tweet and replaced it with a tweet apologising for the delay. All his recent tweets are congratulating people on receiving the giveaways. Don’t let him get away with this OP, he’s still the same shithead, but now with a mask. What an asshole. Ngl though OP, your mails were too deferential. Someone who keeps ignoring your legit claims doesn't deserve any respect. Tag all the big Indian channels in a tweet and post this proof, force the fucker to do something. I don't understand this ""Sir"" mentality of people in India. Any big youtuber or celeb and we start calling them sir sir sir. Just went to his tweeter and the replies were all like ""Sir good pic"", ""nice shot sir"" like jisko izzat deni chahiye usko dete nahi ho lekin sir sir karke kutto ki tarah in youtubers ke peeche bhagte ho.

As for phoneradar, the guy is a sellout. Realme basically baby feeds this guy money. Mooji kaas da Youtubers mokul His twitter is full of his own photos... You could Try reporting video as Scam/Fraud on youtube That's why I watch geekyranjit. Post a link to this thread on the video and keep posting the link until you receive the phone on hand with warranty. And I am unsubscribing him on YT This amit bhawani guy has been a douchebag since his early days on YT.. Glad for you that matters got resolved.. And Gr8 that reddit India has been able to help you out.. More power to the people Typical Indian youtuber who has got his head pretty far up his backside. That idiot Technical Guruji has made iPhone 11 pro giveaway an impossible task. He says that the video should receive 2 million likes for him to choose winners. What a fucking idiot. Don't delete the posts mate. Keep the posts and update that you got it xyz days later. 
The person is still at fault My 2 cents - Even if you get the phone, don't delete the posts. Ordinary people get famous on Youtube, and the success goes to their head. They lose all politeness, and expect their rabid fan base to defend whatever the hell they do. Unfortunately, all too common. This is what Reddit is for! Our country is known for scammers .. I seriously don’t understand why Indians (us) follow indian you tubers when there are a million better ones out there ? It’s free guys. Watch the best . Honestly this felt so good from start to finish.

Kudos to you to have the patience and determination to put this up So did you get the phone? What a scum! How can he put the blame on false claim? Didn't he himself send you the ""congratulation"" mail on your email-id? All he had to do is check the email-id if he thought it was a wrong guy claiming the phone. Looser giving out stupid reason. He just posted some giveaway winners on twitter let's go and say you are not gonna give them phones anyway. Fuck yeah, this subreddit is making ""noise"". That gives me a lotta hope. No reason to delete anything. The whole line argument is suspicious. You deserve that phone as promised and the channel deserves to be exposed for falling back on their marketing promises. Thats one pos channel .

These tech channels dont give proper review and instead post these fake giveaways to attract people and generate revenue   . Chutiya guruji is another one. Good job. This is the aspect of social media I like. Months of inaction and as soon as they started getting some heat online they change their tune. 

Kudos OP. Hope you get your phone soon. Please update us with a pic of the phone! Well it’s just a giveaway anyway! I never trust these kind of promotions.  

But thanks for putting this up.. ! Beware of phooneradar! Commented on that giveaway video to report the channel and unsubscribe. I know how it feels. Once I won the autographed t-shirt by musician jay Sean. And it never arrived to me. I wished someone could help me that time. But it's time I help you. Do not remove this post. Let him understand the value of words. #PhoneRadar #Amit, if you're reading this comment then know that I know you're reading this post while crying. Stop doing this with the winners. You prick. I am really happy to hear that your immediate issue was resolved. 

It's especially tasty when the person(s) in question get all stressed about their reputation and being called out in public. 

It really goes to show that the attitude behind the giveaway was purely to increase viewers and popularity (which, by itself, is not a bad thing) and then his audacity to claim that you were being punished with a delayed delivery and a lack of response due to you _rightfully_ asking for what is yours?! 

The fact that it took multiple attempts, across half a year, and a public outcry for the lil shit to reply tells me all I need to know about what Desi YouTuber to avoid next. 

YouTubers have to realise that if their actual personality is made public, and is abrasive to public outlook, common sense and decency; Then the quality/type of your content is not going to much of a consideration when I have 5 other alternatives who seem to be (or at least seem to display) a better, more personable character. I'd rather watch a nice person try hard to put up some good stuff, than _knowingly_ watch a selfish, and rather cowardly, person put up something more flashy. I know the issue is resolved & we are expecting the shipment of the phone soon, but just commenting coz I am happy about the power of our reddit community. Cannot lie scammers walk away free. 

Congratulations Chaitanya! Lol phoneradar ..They don't know shit about mobile phones. Paid reviews , just like those other ""tech"" yt channels. The YouTuber changed his tweet reply. Mentioned it in the post. I say exposure him further. Post their scam attempt on twitter with proof. Post this on all your social media accounts. Insta, FB, everywhere. Forward to your WhatsApp contacts as well. Jabtak mil na jaye delete mat karna Upvoting for visibility I'm unsubscribing Directly contact people who sponsored that giveaway.
I am sure you will get this fixed within weeks. I stopped watching him after that asshole spoiled infinity war just a day before I was going to watch Lmao the YouTuber has his head so far up his ass he probably eats his food twice. 

You did what anyone would have. His excuse that he didn't ship it cause you ""spammed"" is half assed af. 

Hope you get your phone soon OP. If anybody is interested, you can use this link to report abuse/violation of YouTube policies [https://www.youtube.com/reportabuse](https://www.youtube.com/reportabuse).

FYI the channel link is [https://www.youtube.com/user/advicesmedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/advicesmedia)

In my eyes, this is clearly a case of false Advertisement and Scam/Fraud. what so ever reason.

He is posting a pics of his BUSINESS CLASS journey in another channel dubbed ""triprazer"".

He showoff by sharing a pics of his two Audi Cars and Tesla bookings.

He should easily buy such phone and send him without a single question.

LAME EXCUSE...  What to expect from Others. :( #RipIndianMenatalityToScam Knowing oppo, that phone is probably hot garbage by now anyways. upvoted Thanks OP for highlighting it. I'm going to Unsubscribe from Phoneradar. Also if you don't give a damn about the phone, tweet the issue to youtube india and youtube global. I am one of the first winners of the some of the early giveaways ran on the YT channel “PhoneRadar”. 
(Like 2 years back) 
I won Samsung Galaxy J7 NXT. 

It took like 3-4 months but it eventually got delivered. 

I am not taking anyone’s side. But I feel for you. I know that feeling. I had to randomly ask him about the giveaway update. I also had his whatsapp number, we had an official PhoneRadar group 3 years back. I was part of it. Still It took time. Mainly because of  issue in shipping a phone via local courier in India. 
But nevertheless, he should have given you update now and then as in my case I always got the reply. 

At the end , I wish You will get your prize before the new year. 
Good luck. Dada aandala ee post deppodchi. Mange malpunakulu masth uller, maatheregla gotthavodu. Good work man! Why did he bother to contact you in the first place when he didn’t wanted to give you the phone? I mean who is checking if he actually gave way the phone? Most of these Indian youtubers are cringy scammers. Op, I hope u get your reward Is he considered an Indian phone scammer? Am so glad you made this post and it got the traction it did. Hope you get the phone soon. Ise kehte hai Naam bade darshan chote  . the funniest thing is i found this guy on youtube because i was searching how to file report in case of fraud. So the video guided how he won against scammers in consumer court. Seems he has became the same villain now. Why the fuck does everyone address him as Amit sir? 

The whole Twitter profile is verbal diahorrea man. Do you have a screenshot of where he replied you to stop spamming? We need more heroes like you 👏 This guy earned 3.2 crore last year. Aur iski ek phone pe fat gayi hai. PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS POST What a pain in the ass Tldr kaha hey I’m waiting for update 5 Take the phone anyway. Better, if you'd like, take the phone and re-sell it. I wonder what prevents YT celebrities from remaining humble or admitting they made a mistake once they become a celebrity..

I mean mistakes happen or delays happen. All he had to do was apologize and fix it by trying to resolve the situation. Instead he has to attack someone by making them think they are the problem or the reason the mistake happened. 

Just unsubscribe and move on folks. He doesn't deserve your subs or views if all the status that he has achieved has turned him a prick or douchebag! Have reported his channel, you all should do the same. May I also just say, you haven't LOST anything. You didn't gain anything in the first place. This whole thread is Gold. These Indians YouTube pricks need to be shown their place. Does India have contest/prize promotion laws? In the USA there are a bunch of regulations involved when companies do a contest like this, they may be breaking the law here Everyone is doing the same thing ... just to get views and likes ...no one gives away anything for free that easily ... Hats off to you for standing up and telling the truth ... that’s the problem with blind followers .... the rich getter richer ... And they don’t care what the reality is ... Congratulations! 

I've always thought that they create fake accounts and pick them as winners.

Congratulations again! Keep us posted. Guys a fraud. Just unsubscribe and spread this post everywhere Phone mil raha hain ab? punkass bitchass About the deletion part, and I've heard this from tons of PR agencies, I get that the posts are bad for the business's PR but do they compensate you for deleting your posts/ask you nicely to do so/straight up threaten you to do so? Chutiya ...stop following these channels I know amit sir very well. He would not scam anyone. He is the asshole for not honouring his words. 

However, i never get why people from well to do family ask for giveaway of things that they can buy themselves and don't really need. How is this a scam? Also, why are you so needy about something you were gonna receive for FREE through a giveaway? I wouldn't have bothered after the first 2-3 emails because it's not worth my time. Do you really think give aways work? Especially in India? Sorry man, you were just gullible. These things don't work at all Dude, I won a lottery worth 1 crore without even participating. I got a confirmation on sms. 
I sent them my bank details and still waiting for the money. How long should I wait before I create a reddit post. Bhai ek free phone ke liye kitna bada bawal kar diya tune. hahaha

I see no scam here. A scam is when someone tries to take something from you. That isn't happening here. He didn't ask you for your bank account or card details. He probably was low on funds and didn't want to spend more. But you pulled his reputation down.

All for a free phone. First of all congratulations on your win....but bro stop whining on reddit...no one gives a shit about you not getting your prize."
Politics,"Not taking sides arbitrarily, but for certain people from a certain part of the political spectrum who glorify Nathuram Godse, do they ever think twice or thrice before condemning Mahatma Gandhi for losing territory because....?",4,e2ul8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e2ul8h/not_taking_sides_arbitrarily_but_for_certain/,9,"because considering how both sides were already so religiously inclined, it was likely that a civil war could have broken out in the subcontinent that could have been worse and more territory lost? Not many years after Independence, even the Sikh religious extremists wanted to separate from the Union. The civil war that could have broken out in 1947 or later, had partition never occurred, could have likely even resulted in a much smaller Union of India than it is today.

Also, why would these people fret and complain about lost territory so much when in fact, those regions were for a long time dominated by Muslim majority populations? Did they think they could somehow convert all of them to ahem, you know....their own religion? The process of conversion would inevitably lead to violence and international interference especially when this is after WW2 when the largest pogrom happened in Europe.

India would have to contend with other more stable countries interfering and that would have likely created more geo-political mess and maybe even a crack and break and the Union would cease to exist as it does today.",NobleCandleHolder," Does nobody except me *understand* these idiots?

It's not about being true to reality. It's about being true to *ideology*. And ideology says that secular people are traitors and cowards, while hindu supremacists are always right.

Therefore, Gandhiji is simultaneously the omnipotent leader of the Independence Movement whenever you want to criticise him on partition, but a completely useless side project whenever you want to take away his credit for our independence.

Trying to ""Gotcha"" them with facts is useless. They'll just muddle the issue until even you aren't sure about what's true and what's false.

Classic disinformation  tactics. [deleted] This is something the stupid nationalists and stupid liberals both do not want to acknowledge.

Without Partition, the population ratio of Muslims in the undivided India would have been much higher. What would happen then?

If you use the logic of the anti-Muslim parties and people, then that would have been an unmitigated disaster. In that view Muslims would have asserted their strength and culture strongly, and that would lead to huge clashes and perhaps even civil war. So these anti Muslim people should be relieved that Partition happened. Many of them are. They just do not want to say it or admit it.

The rest, the noisy ones who still dream of an undivided India are idiots. They are likely to react with abuse or violence if you ask them this question!

The liberals - again, those who I call the Buzzfeed / 'Top 10 things that make you a liberal' liberals - tell themselves it will be all sweet and sacharine and love and honey in an undivided India. Alternatively, some of them think that a stronger, bigger Muslim population would have led to more acceptance of Muslims by Hindus. Is this possible? Well, I can imagine it sort of in South India and Maharashtra but in the North? 

There is a slight chance that things may have worked out alright. This would have required Jinnah and all the Congress leaders to work together to achieve. That was a time when leaders could actually lead and followers would follow - and if they trusted each other, and decided to make it work, there was a chance. But Jinnah did not trust Congress or Hindus. Wisely? Those who went to Pakistan may agree. Turned out good for us too, perhaps we avoided a Civil War thanks to the British.

Who knows."

Although, he still doesn't see a viable alternative to Narendra Modi as the PM, he also started to acknowledge that Kejriwal is doing in his own words, ""some good things in Delhi that media isn't reporting""

Don't lose hope if you are facing the same situation at home. Keep on making the rational arguments and tell them the facts. You'll get through. If anyone can change the minds of your parents, it's you.

Happy belated Diwali guys!",randomvariable10," IMO (contrary as it may seem to most views here), BJP voters don't vote out of bhakti or anything. This is apparent from how state  elections (both before the LS elections and those after that) had Congress pulling in with good numbers. Even in my family of Modi worshippers,. people make fun of people like Yeddyurappa. 

The reason Modi won a second time is because BJP has successfully projected LS elections as a Presidential race. And there is literally nobody who exudes the same confidence as Modi in the opposition. Even with the economy crumbling, the average guy would see Modi capable of handling the mess than Raga or anybody else. 

The only way Congress can fight BJP in the next elections is if they build a solid top line on whose reputation they can fight.

As i see it, the economy is only going to slow down further in the next couple of years. In this time, if Congress can rope in people like Nandan Nilekani, Raghuram Rajan (and some top tier Army guy for the defense/home posts)  and project them as the PM/FM candidates from the party, then that will tilt the scales in their favor. 

Perhaps, they could also fight the campaign with a tagline like ""Ab ki baar, padhe likhe logon ki sarkaar"" No matter how hard I try the argument from them is ""toh Rahul Gandhi Ko pm Bana de kya"" and the scams in time of Congress rule doesn't help either It has been really hard man. I came home a week back and I am noticing so many improvements in Delhi. All credit goes to Kejriwal and team. Things are getting better but it seems like there is some suppression happening.

All discussions over BJP and Modi end up being a little pushy. Modi has acquired a cult of personality to the likes of Putin in Russia. That will be hard to beat. Good job OP 👍.. One down.. 22,90,75,169 more to go.. We all has been infused one thing There’s no alternative.
1) As per Indian voting, we vote to elect MLA or MP from our constituency.
2) We are not voting for PM of nation. As PM will be from that party who wins more constituencies.
3) person if defeated can be minister or prime minister. 

It’s not our responsibility to elect PM. PM Won’t come to our constituency to fix potholes and sewage issue or others. Nation is being run and administrated by babus.

So we must educate people to elect local guys and forgets about who will rule. What things made him think that the current government feels more like a dictatorship? sadly not same for me... my dad still blind for our supreme leader... Kunal Kamra said it best

""That's right there's no alternative. Let's call back the Britishers. Simon! Come back!"" He will still vote for BJP and the majority of BJP voters will still remain intact especially in LS elections. 

These masses hate Gandhi family to the core. And even thou if I u argue logically they do have a strong argument like 45-50% population was defecating in open? What development does UPA be doing during that time if they can't even provide toilets? How do u counter that? No worries. My family hates that wannabe generalissimo. Please tell me how did you do it, so that i can get it to my father's mind that BJP is not holier than thou? Just curious, what are the talking points for or against modi? How about we vote? And then voice our opinions on the same. I'm getting mine done for the next elections. Teach me Sensei As much as I hate BJP and Mudi... I'll never try to change the opinion of anyone in favour of any other political party. Especially won't try this with my family or friends... they are free-thinking individuals and it's not wise to discuss politics with family.

I mean surely tell him that BJP is shit. But don't try to change his opinion on AAP on Congress... Unless of course you are running for election. What rational arguments did you use? Can You post them here for sake of knowledge? Although i agree with you, i voted BJP both times and will continue to do so till there is a better alternative or BJP becomes much worse Whoever is elected , corruption will remain. Modi isn't good but at least he does take action. I'm no Modi fan but he is kind of a fox with strategies. Compared to majority of BJP, He has brain. It's the RSS and others who are BJP's parents , child etc that I dislike.

Maybe because I live in South of India, UDF & LDF are the only ones ruling here. BJP don't get much votes because their representatives often give Public hate speeches here. Those who does get elected are often corrupted.  As for Kejriwal's Aam Admi, It's almost non existent because they are too close to UDF that they are kinda unanimous. So compared to past leaderships, Modi seemed bit better to me ( as a president only , not when he was minister ). 

True that BJP is oppressing minorities. Is trying to make India like China. But from my ( southee who was often a Leftie ) view, Modi seem better than others.

I know I will get downvotes,
 but hopefully someone will share what Makes Modi bad guy so I will know your view.


Edit : 

I agree that Modi's rule is more of dictatorship. Since other ministers are too dumb, it's just him. Still if you try to read article 370, it's too vague but it is part of India according to to contract. But past government was too focused on not causing tension that they just juggled it to next government. It's like Someone get raped, government is afraid of some people that the arrests gets postponed. Good for you but tbh I would still vote for bjp. Delhi can have their fun with kejriwal and whatever he did but out here BJP has done some work so I am not voting with modi in mind. Then there is also a question of if not modi the would you want rahul? I'm in the same boat,but there is no alternative to modi-which is why I don't even bother fighting and wasting energy I am sure if elections happen right now and it's Modi vs RaGa again, your dad will vote for Modi, again. Good job, Its a very hard thing to do. I failed miserably at this and have given up. Out of curiosity, what arguments did you use? Very keen on knowing them to bolster my own. Quite clearly, major pro BJP sentiment comes from the fact that there is ""No other alternative"" and quite literally.
This doesn't seem it is going to popup out of the blue.
Kejriwal is written off by the public (Haryana polls? Punjab? Wait for Delhi.)
And we're not even talking about INCongress.

Cry as much as you want. Bring an alternative that can stand a week in front of Mr.Modi in election campaigning and knows how to sway people's sentiments or just quit being keyboard warriors. go blame EVMs! The main profit or you can say a positive point for B.J.p is only that no other opposition party have a good leader. B.j.P party is not good but the leader is one of the best India ever got. He represents India and in many circumstances due to his aura the reputation of India in outside countries have increased drastically. You can say he is a good leader or a good speaker... 
I know that just because of one person we can't give vote to a party but there is no other option.

It's like Monopoly Market Congress has to distance itself from Gandhi family. This ain't gonna happen anytime soon. Nobody knows who represents congress. Absolute lack of leadership. Also, state election and national election are now different ballgame. The party which will see betterment for my country, I will Vote. Have been voting for BJP, will continue to do so. just came to upvote the OP for this thread I want to hand over my dad to you for a day. OP you made my day. Thank you. I live in hope when my Dad will not 'blindly' vote. I think most people vote for BJP because of the sense of security they have been feeling since 2014. 

Before BJP, there were frequent terrorist attacks. There hasn't been a major attack after 2014 in any major cities. 
And on top of this, BJP govt keeps the the anti-Pak narrative going all the time. 
It's really easy to get the votes of majority of the middle class voters. My parents are Christians, when bjp got elected, all the family talks were like bjp is restricting that, it will Target Christians etc from 2014 
I was like don't worry, they can't just go and Target religious groups unnecessarily, there are courts and even fellow ppl will stand up if govt goes to that extent!

2019
All this talk about Hindu nation, heard meghalaya court also agreed that secular word removed and country should be made a Hindu nation. 
No man, whatever new things or improvements ( policies) they brought, we are going back in open mindedness!! Many people have failed to turn me and my mother into BJP voters. What I really count is Free data , Bobs and vagene & Akhand Bharat . Let us join ... Dishoom.... When the BJP wins another Assembly and the very next General elections...will you think you could have made better use of your time?
Indian reddit is largely anti-BJP and anti Modi. The fact remains...they can't be stopped before 2024! Unless you successfully malign the flag-bearer!

Looking at the current feeling of people and going by the recent assembly results, that isn't likely to happen guys! When saying ""It took me 3 years to change my Dad's mind"", don't you think you were the dictatorial person who is against freedom of thinking ? xD Mat bol bhai... Kuch chutiye aajayenge chillane. Sabki gaand me aag lag chuki hogi Congratulations.

I think more and more people will start opening their eyes as the govt's bullshit becomes impossible to ignore (PMC Bank scam link, economic slowdown, RBI surplus fiasco, EVMs in Satara, etc). Hopefully they do before it's too late. Congratulations Brother! Ya man my parents too hate him it does feel like communist style I'm glad you were successful in changing his mind. I've tried and failed to change the opinion of my parents on the same issue. But I haven't lost hope. My attempts will continue. So whom do you support? In the next election he will again vote for BJP... May be he wanted to get rid of your noise My dad changed his mind on his own during term 1 and voted for BSP in the last general election (BSP fielded the candidate with the least amount of criminal charges in his constituency). Reddit is very anti-Modi. I just joined and I'm really confused as to why. Please don't kill my karma points. Congratulations OP. So proud of you. Your post brought me to tears. I wish I was even 1% brave like you. even as a person firmly in their middle age and starting the arduous trek though to old age, i feel that votes should be skewed in favour of the youth.

""ageism"" doesn't apply here; or rather, applies in a manner opposite to traditional discrimination arguments.

the youth are more educated and more in touch with happenings. they also have to live longer with the choices that we, as a population make. if it is Father I would do this, but in my case it is my FIL & MIL... they have become heavily brainwashed, if we are on a road trip(not India) and if they lose data signal more than a minute they freak out ('coz they cant download the video they just received in whatsapp , yes the propaganda videos ) also a fan of Arnab and repulbic TV. Make a new party that has fresh issue like environmental challenge facing the country. All old parties and also AAP have lost modernity completely. We need a new party to celebrate Indianess of sustainable development and radical progressivism combined. One that is against appeasement of minority  of Congress and majoritarian populism of BJP. I've got a question--just how much of the BJP's support is due to Indians' dislike of the Nehru-Gandhi family dominating over the Indian National Congress for 70+ years? After all, when one party is perceived as being the plaything of a powerful political family for decades, one could understand why many people would be inclined to support another party whose leader is from humble roots and styles himself as a man of the people.

It might be similar to the US where in response to decades of Bushes and Clintons being in politics, both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton suffered humiliating losses to Donald Trump in 2016. u/randomvariable10, what points did you make against the current government which moved your father and he came to a realisation that the current government is not doing its job properly and the previous governments where better by a significant margin. Please tell the best two points, i will convince more people. Thanks. I finally found someone who feels that the current central government is in the favor of dictatorship rather than supporting a democratic-ship. We are in dire need of options. Eliminating competition is not fruitful for anyone Good job ! https://slicepay.in/me?rc=SLICE14151 Congress Party is toast, it will be while before they can even think of showing up back on the scene.  Maybe if some celebrities with deep aspirations want to get a new political party that could help.  India needs less gov't not more of it, that's for sure. Just keep fighting with words Haha, this was actually the other way around in my house! I was firmly on Congress side until my dad convinced me BJP was right. It all makes sense now. :) all of BJP's votes exist cuz nobody wants pappu as PM What do you do if your dad thinks that dictatorship is better than democracy, and that ""Indians do not deserve democracy"" There's no alternative to the worst we got How do you do it with conservative grandparents? I’ve tried to talk about the BJP’s dangerous actions many times with them, and they say that since me and my immediate family live in Singapore, “we are not Indian” and therefore cannot have an opinion on Indian politics, let alone a discuss it. Any idea what I could do? But i still love dictatorship! kaise kiya saar? give tips Achievement unlocked: Dad not Bad anymore. 

Happy Diwali everyone ✌ I am sorry to break it you but more than half of India's population is less than 25 , more than 65 percent of India's population is less than 35 . Changing our dad's mind about BJP is a useless strategy . Try targetting your friends who you think are radicalised . In democracy you're not supposed to influence others to vote or not to vote for specific candidate/party. Democracy is about  every individual will thinking for himself, If the candidate has done or promised to do things that an individual needs him to do then that individual should vote for him. When you're trying to influence your father against BJP, you're no different than all those parties who try to influence masses of people. You can present what the candidate has done in past years but influencing others takes away the whole point of democracy and at last vote for the candidate not party. I agree with you that Kejriwal is doing a decent job but on the second point if you feel that Modi Government is more of dictatorship well if it had been true , you would not have been posting over here My family back in india used to always vote Congress until Manmohan Singh's term ended after that, they don't see any other leader being able to lift the burden of India. Modi got elected not because he was the best candidate but because there was no other candidate. What problem do people have with BJP government? The economy is doing very well, the box office collections of Joker and War were amazingly high. If you are getting brainwashed by the numbers, remember, those numbers didn't help Einstein discover gravity. Finally it all boils down to millennials. They are the biggest problem . I am a BJP voter. There is nothing no one can do to change my mind. I really find it amusing when people correlate that if a person is well educated, it means that they are naturally good at leadership. Agreed that there is a high chance of them being good leaders but I do believe that formal education has got little to do with...

There are great organizations formed by people who dropped out of college, or downright illiterate..but what they did have was the business acumen, strategy and instincts that brought them success.. I dont think they teach all these things in ""school""..

Governing a country requires great business skills, negotiating skills, leadership skills and so on.. Basically you must be a don of your block which is your country.. On a bigger stage where only 1 percent of the population governs 99% of the population, they dont see your resume before establishing relations. Many of them have inherited their fortune or have brutally claimed it.. So its basically being an alpha that counts. Manmohan singhs rsume would demoralize countless people but  look at his leadership skills.. People in power politics generally put a facade through their qualifications to gain the trust of people. When the shit hits the fan they dont want to be under it.. 

I am pro democracy but I also believe that it is the vote of trustworthy people that should count.. In a land of over a billion people most of whom just care about their daily livelihood,  a democratic system is just a sham.. Its nothing but dictatorship wrapped in democracy.. And its but natural.. 

On the mountain of societal evolution,  dictatorship is the way leading to the summit that is democracy. [removed] Based on my Gujarat experience I knew Modi is dictator, he always about marketing and very little work....corruption is also same as other it is just reserved for higher level and can never be caught

India will realize that Modi's 10 year was total waste of time and in some sense country regressed You did it, you crazy son of a bitch did it. 

Thanks for the motivation btw. [removed] Thanks a lot. Really need to hear stories like this. Apparently giving free stuff to people is ""doing a good thing"". I wish i could do that. Instead i just became quite. Hoping that they'll realise in time. OP you are a hero and should be lauded for not giving up. I hope more people like you convince each other not to vote for the BJP. This is not about Hindu-Muslim anymore. It is about the future of our country. Our economy has been gifted to the 0.1% wealthy and ordinary people like you and me are suffering as we no longer have control over our choices. What is happening in Kashmir is a human rights travesty. Unemployment has never been this low in 50 years. At this rate our growth rate will go close to 0 in the next 20 years. I live in Saudi Arabia because there are no jobs for Engineers. I wanted to work but the fuckers gave me 10k as salary.  Every day I wish I could go back and work in India and contribute in some form to its growth. In my last vacation I was literally shocked to see the cost of living so high. I met a Uber driver who spoke Everything is now so expensive. Apparently there is a nation wide shortage of milk. If the cows are no longer being eaten WTF happened to all the milk.We need change and we need it now. I argue that modi is not a dictator just his style is authoritarian.  India still has strong media. India is still more democratic than most of south asian countries That's assuming dictatorship is a bad thing. thanks for doing that, we need more people like you. Since my family and I are in Kerala, we have never to this date ever even considered voting for BJP Chewtiya Butter jelly peanutbutter is universally beloved. How could you father dislike it in the first place? I am happy u got results... But my opinion is (I may be wrong of course ) that your dad or any indian dad whether BJP supporter or Congress, can only change change their beliefs if it affects them personally, maybe ur dad witnessed something that he thought was wrong or immoral. 
U didn't have a part in it because even if ur dad understands that u are right he will never admit it because of pride. And I am only posting this because I don't want other people to start arguing with their parents just try to have healthy debates or discussion without undermining their opinion. More people should try and convince their friends and family about whatever their political leanings are.. rather than going out on social media , looking for echo chambers and getting into arguments online . Kudos to you ! 🍻 The whole idea I convinced my father to change his ideology is perfect example of dictatorship ideology. You should not try to convince or for your ideology to make someone believe in it.
This is against the democracy. 
The OP is sadly stupid and thinks he/she is cut above everyone because they know better.
This type of mentality has destroyed India in first place.
Let your father keep his political ideology that what democracy is about. Modi is a Far-Right Lunatic. That's as badass as having a threesome in India. If you're trying to change their minds then I guess that's also you shoving your thoughts down their throats. No offense. And I'm not a BJP supporter. Lets establish communism who's in with me??? Why did u do this?

BJP is the best government that our country could hope for. Narendra modi is the storngest willed man that I have ever seen and I am a doc so I have seen some very strong people.

Narendra modi is doing a fantastic job. Sure it may be a little bit without consulting but I believe he has ample skill since he win majority. If he is majority he is pretty skilled I think. He had chosen apt ministers I believe and the people under them who makes our laws are great as well.

What's the problem with BJP? They are going to make our India the top country in free years if you give modi adequate time. What are your views on Communist parties in India?Communists rule over at least 1/4th of the world population if you include China,Laos,North Korea,Vietnam and some democratically elected countries in South America and Nepal.Seeing the progress China has made to become the No.1 economy in the world makes me think about a communist government at the centre. Same situation in my house.

My bhakt daddy counters by saying that look ""These roads are being built by Modi"" or look over there Modi has brought us our Kashmir back..

I say Yes dad I know water is wet but are you aware about the state of Health and Education in BJP ruled states? Modi has still not fulfilled his promise on improving minimum wage.

My dad looks like the typical pumpkin right wing dude that writes works for India TV or Dainik Jagran and overeats whenever he is invited to the wedding of a BJP mantri. We need to throw out all the political parties and hit the reset button."
Politics,"Keeping in mind the recent political drama in Maharashtra, wouldn't it be a much better if National political parties like Congress and BJP were not allowed to stand for State elections?",8,e0jmyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e0jmyg/keeping_in_mind_the_recent_political_drama_in/,10,"Edit: Made a typo in the title. It should be 'wouldn't it be much better' instead of 'wouldn't it be a much better'. 

To elaborate further, wouldn't it be better if National parties were not allowed to have any involvement at all in state elections and state politics (excluding appointment of governors and imposition of president's rule)?

This would also further reinforce the Federal structure of India, allow national parties to focus on national issues and state parties to focus on state issues and prevent a single party from possessing massive amounts of control at the same time. 

I feel like national parties being involved in State politics is a HUGE conflict of interest, especially for the party in power.",jasonj2232," So basically add national prefix to all the parties at central level and add state prefix to all the parties at state level Having a national party and state party dichotomy creates conflict. Look at WB, TN, Kerala, Punjab where the local parties are usually at logger heads with National parties and development suffers. The only loser is the voter and common man,

Instead parties should now be fighting elections on their own. Coalition and alliances are just corruption in a different form. We made defections illegal but horse-trading has shifted before elections. As long as there is corruption there is no perfect formula in the current scenario your idea looks valid but who is to stop those state parties to have connections with the govt at the center , at that time we would think that the national parties should fight in state elections because most state parties will just be a puppet , i remember people in early 2000 - 2012 saying that there should be single majority party at the center as coalitions only become hurdles to the govt but now that we have a majority party we call it a sort of dictatorship ...so its not the system that is bad its the people running it and So, when are parties national parties. When do national parties drop to state parties? this will lead to complicated issues in rajya sabha.. and secondly what about concurrent list. it is difficult to have a consensus in matters vis a vis concurrent list."

~The opposition's pitch (NCP + INC & oth) was miserable condition of the farmers, rampant law and order problems and facist nature of BJP

The results

BJP - 105   SS - 56   NCP - 54   INC - 44  MNS - 1  Others - 19 (Ind, AIMIM, CPI & Others)

~ 2 Cabinet ministers are not given ticket by BJP
~ 6 cabinet ministers lose election
~ BJP president's own district Kolhapur is BJP mukt
~ Majority of the people who switched parties are rejected by voters
~ Mumbai's mayor loses election
~ Thakrey family member (Aditya) becomes first from the family to contest or to be elected 


Who Forms the Government?

~Immidiately after results, Shiv Sena head Uddhav Thakrey says 50% partnership including CM seat for 2.5 years was promised and should be given

~BJP offers (sources/ news{ unconfirmed}) Dy. CM post and Finance and Revenue Department. But Shiv sena wants CM position and Home department as well as Urban Development Department.

~ SS party MP Sanjay Raut talks of being in touch with ""other parties"", BJP does not respond

~Talks of SS forming a government with support of INC and NCP on a high. NCP and INC (officially) deny, SS says there will be a SS CM for 5 years. BJP leader says we may head to President's rule if no party can stake claim

~ BJP Maintains that they will form a government only with Shiv sena. Shiv sena stays firm on CM post demand. Mr. Sharad Pawar says NCP is mandated to be in the opposition.


Today

As of today, no one has claimed to have majority and to form government, though all parties are having meetings at all levels. BJP leaders meet the governor but donot stake claim to form the government.

What next?

If no one stakes claim

Scenario 1

~The governor may ask the present government to continue for a few weeks till new government is formed. This is called a CARETAKER Government. If no one stakes claim, the governor may refer for President's rule. President's rule lasts only for 6 months and has to be ratified every 6 months. President's rule cannot last more than a year except Election Commission reporting to centre it's inability to conduct elections.

Scenario 2

~ BJP accepts SS proposal and forms government with 2.5 years of CM seat sharing, first 2.5 of which are SS. It is yet unconfirmed who will be the CM face from SS and what portfolio (if) is given to Aditya Thakrey

Scenario 3 

~ NCP supports BJP unconditionally (It did last time)

Scenario 4

~ NCP + INC support SS unconditionally and SS CM for 5 years


Edit : 
~Shri Vasantrao Naik has the distinction of being the first CM of completing a full 5 year term

Edit 2: 
~The governor may ask for the present government to continue to deal with Agri Crisis in the state due to unseasonal rains.

~The results of elections rectified as per ECI website.


UPDATE: SCENARIO 1 HAS HAPPENED",themauryan," > Mr. Fadnavis being the only CM to complete a full 5 year term in the history of Maharashtra 

He is the second CM after Vasantrao Naik to complete 5 year term. From SS point of view, they will get more than 1/3rd power with NCP and INC without any tussle as the biggest party of the three. They won't face any voter backlash as they have constantly criticized BJP and Modi which makes their transition natural. BJP needs to offer them something more (state n center) but that won't go down well with BJP MLAs n MPs. 

At some other time BJP would have pushed for president's rule and won the next election by stoking anger against SS. But with worsening economy, BJP may end up doing worse if another election is called.

INC and NCP will happily join any govt. NCP may join BJP govt directly or from outside if given enough benefits. NCP was the biggest winner in this election and would want something for their efforts, either from BJP or from SS.

In all, this may be the toughest test for Amit Shah. Maharashtra looked set for decade of Hindutva dominance but being one of the most urbanized states, the social schemes haven't benefitted as many people as rest of the country while economy slowdown has hit hard. Can the governor ask the current CM to continue as per the scenario 1? Wherever I've read, it says president rule will apply if a new govt doesn't get formed by Saturday when the term of the current assembly ends. ECI results show SS got 56 seats, while NCP got 54 seats (just nitpicking) 


Why's BJP reluctant to give SS CM post? Genuinely curious. They are not in the best of position to fight it out are they? Another election could be counter productive for BJP if opposition smell blood and come out fighting (especially Pawar) and people feel fed up with economy. Wouldn't it make more sense to make deal with SS now and see what happens in future?"

There are two leads for our entire development let's name the leads as A and B. 
I work under A and sometimes people of B's team get assigned our work. One of the member of  B's team got assigned some of our work and she kept calling me to her desk for help even though it was a simple task she just had to put some interest that's it! My lead A saw that and asked me not to help her much and let her learn. But she kept on calling me again and again and it  got me irritated and  told her politely that she is being watched by my lead A and doesn't look good if she keeps calling me for help.
Days passed by and don't when but that lady told her team lead B that my lead A asked me not to help her out.
Now that team lead B is discussing about that with me I was completely blank on what to answer! I just kept quiet.
I am worried that this discussion will somehow reach my lead A and spoil my rapo with him.

In given scenario, 
If your TL has issue with your member of TEAM B. Let your TL talk to Member or what ever they think fit. Here, you obliged with the instructions by communicating your TL concern to the member of TEAM B. As a result you got involved inspite of not being involved.

Don't let others shoot from your shoulder. Firstly don't pass on information from Team A to B or vice versa unless it is official. If it is later do it on email or other official mode of communication. 

Secondly, just say politely if someone complains to you about someone tell them to tell it to TL/Manager or to the person directly. You can’t. Show the number of times on different dates that you offered to help her to Lead B directly and tell its a question of showing common sense and interest from now on! Also tell lead A is noticing your being disturbed and a reduction in your productivity. If he is sensible, he wl understand!! Switch jobs."

# Brewing a storm

post election results the BJP had the plurality (had the largest number of seats) but lacked the majority to form a stable government. ([Results](http://www.elections.in/maharashtra/)). Now Shiv Sena wanted something in return for supporting a BJP government. The lollipop to be given in this case was the CM seat of the state. Shiv Sena asked for a sharing arrangement where their candidate would be CM for half of the tenure and BJP for the other half. BJP did not like this and gridlock.

&#x200B;

# Tripartite Alliance

In accordance with plurality the governor of the state invited BJP. BJP told the governor that they won't be able to form government. BJP was given 48 hours for this. Next came Shiv Sena.They were given 24hrs to prove majority. They said that they could prove majority support and asked for more time to prepare a letter of support (an official document that shows whether MPs actually support them or not). Governor refused to acknowledge their request and moved to next party aka NCP. They too were given 24 hours to prove ... But before 24hrs had passed president's rule was imposed in Maharashtra.

In order to keep BJP out of power SS, NCP and INC started discussing the possibilities of an alliance. The tripartite pact reached some kind of agreement and were ready to announce it next day.

# Conspiracy Zone

Skip this section if you want only concrete info.

So in the tripartite arrangement, possibly Ajit Pawar was excluded from power or given some rather menial charge. So either someone ambitious from BJP got wind of this or Ajit Pawar thought he might be able to get a better deal from BJP. So he meets BJP bigwigs, makes a deal with BJP in the wee hours of the night and next morning by 8:10AM he is sworn in as Dy CM along with Devendra Fadnavis as CM (to the dismay of several newspaper publishers). 

&#x200B;

# While the (political) world sleeps

Ajit Pawar and BJP strike a power sharing deal. Ajit Pawar manages to get a bunch of signatures from fellow MLAs cos he's rather big in NCP and somehow manages to provide the governor with a letter of support. This very much surprises the Nation (newspaper publishers most of all), and makes the Tripartite alliance very very angry.

So angry that in-fact this is challenged in Supreme court. And this brings us to today. When SC has in typical Indian fashion told us that kal karenge (i.e. we will have a look at it tomorrow)",Smooth_Detective," Guys let's discuss everything in one place. So that we can reach more people. I will do my best to try and keep the thread updated as much as possible IMO Ajit Pawar is now the guy everyone's after. Hither and Tither.

Otherwise Sharad pawar must have removed him from party. > When SC has in typical Indian fashion told us that kal karenge (i.e. we will have a look at it tomorrow)

I have observed that in all sides of the political spectrum, there are some famous Twitteratis who don't really reveal themselves, and post about politics almost all day.

Nothing much can be found about them from the internet other than that they are Twitter 'celebs'. It seems as if these people don't really have much work to do other than post on Twitter and rant about 'leftists' and 'rightists'.

No wonder Bhagat Singh never participated in the communist parties what's your ideology ? I am a Hindu Communist. Dear CPI, If you are really communists then please conduct a seminar on Karl Marx, conduct seminars on rationalism, socialism and spread scientific temperament and social awareness. You would not be able to counter Hindutva by seminars on Vedas and Upanishads. lol These idiots won't understand that logic can't beat emotion. The current Hindutva wave tugs at the emotional heartstrings of millions of men and women; and most of the Communists are a part of that too. They won't accept it at face value, but their beliefs are the same as that of the cow brigade.

A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

You can be sure that the Modi *kaka* controlled ECI will not support this.

Personally, I feel this is very much needed. This will bring closer scrutiny on the police by the the politicians and make them more accountable, if and when fake cases are filed. But that's another thing the politicians don't want - an accountable police force. Why even give the decision to ECI? Just use your powers SC! This is a good thing!

Today we were having another 1-to-1 meeting where we talking about general work stuff and he mentioned it again. But upon asking more he said, ""he will think through it"" and I will get it ""in due time"". 

We are a small team of 6 people. Recently the business took a hit due to some policy changes and we were asked to work 10x harder and ""stay committed"". The project that is usually delivered is 2-3 months, we were able to deliver it in record 12 days. The project that I was assigned was deemed important before starting out but upon completion it was labelled as ""less important"". The other two projects are at 70% and 40% completion at the end of 20 days and are apparently more important than my project. 

Now we usually get a Flipkart or other voucher as Diwali ""bonus"" but looking at the situation, I'm not very keen on accepting it. 

It is very clear that he is stalling my requests and I'm being shafted big time. I have turned down 5 offers to stay in the current job because I was ""committed"" but looks like it isn't worth it. The last offer was 2 months ago and paid 2x more.

Because it just feels so wrong.",HistoricalPotential1," Loyalty is overrated. Atleast in the IT sector. If you get a 2x offer, take it and run! don't make any petty moves out of emotions. look at the big picture. look for better opportunities at other places. Accept the diwali gift and say thank you along with a return gift. One of the best career advices I've got it is :

""The company owes you nothing and you owe the company nothing "".

It's just business. Nobody else will take care of you other than yourself.

I've followed this advice religiously. And I must say that I've never regretted it. Take what you get and find another job. Tell him that you are not celebrating diwali this year because there is too much work to do at the office. Why not accept the gift and you make a gift to him too. That way you won't feel bad when you leave. This sounds too much like me. Being ""too committed"" to the company, not getting enough raises, small team working overtime, rejecting better paying offers due to ""loyalty"".  
Well now I've much better sense and I'm resigning tomorrow, after getting 2 better offers. Resign before Diwali and directly say no for it. > The last offer was 2 months ago and paid 2x more 

Should have taken it, given you had the intention of leaving this current job and going to the one you got the offer from. Anyway, take the Diwali card I would say."
Politics,I am planning on starting a Kejriwal as PM campaign. Can someone do the math for me on how long it will take to spread to 50 crore Indians?,117,e0ik3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e0ik3a/i_am_planning_on_starting_a_kejriwal_as_pm/,93,"Here is what I will do. I will approach 5 Indians everyday between age group 15 to 25 as they are most open minded amongst all.

I will ask them if they support Kejriwal or not. If they say no, I will give them facts, convince them about truth on why Kejriwal as PM is the only hope for India and then ask them to change mind of 5 new people every day like this. These 5 people shall also do the same and so on.

So I want to spread the virus of political truth in such manner. 

Can some one do the math for me on how many days it will take to reach 50 crore Indians if this virus of truth spreads in the way I imagine it would?",FreedomIdeas," You can campaign all you want, but if they don't contest elections in more states then how would they come into power in the centre? Aap is very much non existent in my state. Make a website. Add all the info on it. Do a weekly podcast and put it on the site.
 

Make a pamplet distribute it to those 5 people a day. Use QR codes to allow people to scan the pamphlet and get more info. Math didnt help mudiji win election Are you backed by the party or doing it on your own? Not to dissuade you but let me tell you something. Look beyond the bubble of a small percentage of Indians who have stable jobs, houses and a comfortable life and complain/care about environment, development and fiscal deficits. There is a huge chunk of people in India who don't have much. They dont vote for a candidate because he promises them free electricity, free house, free xyz, they vote because they feel they can get their work done through them. 

In India, when you have a problem, the police, administration and courts are really useless for someone without connections. It is political pressure that helps you get cases registered, gets you water connections, helps roads get built. It is a system of getting work done through your local politician. Its not the right system, but it is what exists and its not changing because those in power like to keep it that way. You can explain every possible good thing Kejriwal can do for this country, but people in villages, tier 3 cities, towns would never care to vote for someone who thinks of the big picture. All they care about is a candidate who will get their shit done. This is why people vote for the candidates they vote for in small towns, not because they have been brainwashed by speeches and promises. Count me in! I also plan to donate to the AAP when I start earning. I have said this before, they are my last hope in Indian politics. They have their hearts and minds in the right place.

I believe only education can solve India's biggest problems--population, intolerance, unemployment, corruption and what not. They have changed the face of education in Delhi in just 5 years. Here they don't even have the power to make a new university, I can only wonder what they could do if they were ruling a full state at least. Anti-corruption, decentralization, localism, fractalism, sustainability, peace, freedom, and prosperity need a boost in societal consciousness and have cemented buy-in with people as a vector for any democratic constitutionalist to receive power and use it well. Arvind represents the absolute best of the politician and policymaker intersection with him, unfortunately, having to bear the burden of Gandhi and Nehru simultaneously in an age devoid of Gokhale or GD Birla. Every action in cash or kind that opposes centralization, carbonization, criminalism, corruption, casteism, and communalism will help him.

It depends on the next three years. Delhi 2020 and Punjab 2022 will be critical. And there are too many variables and push/pull forces that will determine what political alliance and organizational/political growth + restructuring will happen. I think AAP's best strategy is to bolster these ideals in every state in India to generate local leaders around those ideas and spread itself as possible.

To minimize the cost of communication, and conversion in politics, it would best to consolidate a idea-based political organization and political machine over the next few years in Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Punjab with a geographic and cultural proximity, grow in Goa, Jharkhand and other low population density states in a decentralized devolved manner and enter the major metropolises and top 50 cities by Indian population by porting Delhi model of governance that actually is measurable and works.

I've spent 6 years in politics and policy looking at city governance, politics and election campaigns in different states. I think we can think of a framework to think about this problem and come up with different estimates. But the rubber hits the road when you build it as a stack and iteratively go along.

I do think that the 5 persons a day conversion doesn't work as a geometric progression in those timelines since relentless war of ideas will be on in most Indian geographies and it usually takes a lot more than a day's arguments to convince the human mind to accept and spread. Politics has also been seen as a zero-sum game of prestige and status, while it can a positive-sum game of value and impact. That in itself doesn't attract enough fair democrats with voices and power to influence votes since they mostly stay in market or society instead of entering the state or the route to power in the same. Knowledge and power are a bit conflicting in the politics and policy ecosystem.

Bernie Sanders, Park Won Soon, Babatunde Fashola, Ekrem Imamoglu, Pete Buttigieg, Eric Garcetti, and Anne Hidalgo are some interesting comparative studies to parallelly study and learn from in my opinion as they co-evolve.

I think something that involves and discusses Delhi with the rest of the country and the world could be quite fruitful. Dilli, Desh aur Duniya, for example. Or Jo Kaha So Kiya? Or Delhi Dialogue? Any Redditors who might want to collaborate on this, work on it and fund/fundraise/volunteer for it? We'll need an IT/Tech lead, a social media lead, content lead and communication folks (shooter, editor, designer). I can definitely provide a lot of content! 

PS: I volunteer with the Aam Aadmi Party Party, advise the Delhi Government and do a few things/gigs in sustainability, digital communication and growth/strategy consulting. I also wrote the Delhi Dialogue manifesto along with Ashish Khetan, the late Meera Sanyal and Adarsh Shastri, which we've been following up on over the last five years. Has been a phenomenally interesting time and learning experience. 

I tweet at roshankar and use the same for gmail. Happy to chat on this or do an AMA anytime here. Can maybe ask a few friends (MLAs and Ministers) to come over here and chat as well.

Let me know r/india :) Just one advice: create Whatspp messages in Hindi and add some pics and spread  them Facts don't get you votes, a narrative does. You should keep that in mind while you do this work. 13 days.

5¹² = 244,140,625
5¹³ = 1,220,703,125 Okay, I have worked out the math. If you consider that the 5 people you talked to would pass on the support for Kejrival to exactly 5 people, and so on; it would take **12 days for you to reach  24,41,40,625 (around 24.5 crore)** Indians. It would then take **another day for you to reach 1,22,07,03,125 (around 1.2 billion)** people, which is around the population of India. 

The problem with this is that you expect people to pass your message to exactly 5 people who have never heard of your message before, which is virtually impossible to do. Forget 50 crore Indians. See if you could convert a few in UP. The Hindi belt is mainly where BJP gets votes. UP matters the most. Good luck, my dude. Serious question: are WhatsApp forwards a part of your strategy? Frankly, he needs to spend some time as the Delhi CM and build his image as an accomplished CM before he looks to aim for the PM post All the best bro! Voices need to be heard. I support you but the best way to reach others is through social media or Youtube. Something like official peeing human's channel. I am not an AAP'ian. His solutions dont scale. Kejriwal lost all credibility when his MP were accused of not showing full assets in affidavit and still stayed in power. Sorry, mate was AAP supporters in 2014 but not anymore. 12 days. (11.179 days to be more precise)

Formula: compound interest with 
principle=1,
rate=500%,
compounded daily.

Edit: days= log(500000000)/log(1+500/100) Your over estimate how smart Indian voters are.

Go find a religion/demographic which ~45% can **hate** - that is the only way to get power in India. Convince me why kejriwal is best?

Delhi's pollution is because of him right?, As he is the CM.

These are all genuine remarks, I really want to know! Give or take about 50 years or more .. If u want the message to be spread a lot more faster than that , u need the Modi run  media on Ur side .. 

You need kejriwal like leader in every state ,in every muncipality.
Setting up a organisation is not a joke.

Congress has pan India presence because of the likes of Gandhi nehru.
BJP has pan India presence because of their hindutva ideology.

What you need is a ideology which can enable politician like kejriwal to setup an organization.

Doing such gimmicks like kejriwal for PM won't work,,, in maharastra Raj thackeray is loved by masses, but the reason he fails Everytime is that he doesn't have an organization buildup like ncp Shivsena congress BJP. After the Maharashtra shit show people’s vote don’t matter at all. Do something better with your time! It's not that voters do not know about AAP or Kejriwal. The thing is people only vote for the candidate/party who have realistic chance of winning the election. Given the nature of FPTP system, In most states, only two or atmost three strong parties are in the race. Very difficult to displace them. It’s useless. AAP is now a one state party. I want Tharoor as PM. Nah, bud. 
You have got your priorities wrong. 

Our nation's builders weren't so naive that they would allow something like a presidential democracy. 
You and everyone of us don't need to bother with who the PM will be.If you are really motivated on doing something for the country, try and spread the message instead that people should just vote for the best area representative of their area.
No need to look at party or anything else.Just their performance as someone with power. 

All of the parties do have good politicians.They are just very scarce and very weak as no one cares to talk about them and what they want to do.In a country of a billion dreams, it's almost impossible for 1 of us to not have thought of joining these ""corrupt parties"" and correct them from the inside out.
All we, as the people, need to do is to give power to these weakened individuals.They are still there.

Arvind Kejriwal is not a good choice for a PM.He is a not great leader or even a great politician.He is just a great person.He will work much better at state level under a great leader than being the leader himself.


Tl;dr 
Make people aware that their area representative is what matters, not the national party neither the face of the country.(PM)
It's a much easier task to do and a much more overlooked one. 
If you do do that, that would be actually helpful to the country.Doing anything else like bringing another party to power because of the appeal of that guy you like will just bring more disasters into the country's powers. 
Especially after electoral bonds, it is VERY NECESSARY to not give one party too much power. why is this post allowed? As an official sub for India it should be politically neutral and should not allow campaigning for a particular party. Kejriwal se Delhi to sambhal nahi raha😅😁 Please don't put pressure on him. You are kidding right? You never spelt out why you want to Kerjiwal for PM? Maybe start convincing folks on reddit? Good thoughts. 

I would join in but currently I have some family problems that I have to solve first.

Wish more people would join in.

Talk to people, that always works.

I'd say start a youtube channel asap which compares AAP's governance with other states, tell about candidates too.

Start a whatsapp group, add other people who support AAP to that group. People will support more if they see there's already a lot of people supporting them. And whatsapp in India, has more reach than FB or even youtube. Create an FB page and discussion group too while you are at it.

Write social media posts, retweet tweets from their handle.

Contact AAP, they will tell you what to do. Delhi elections would in Feb, you can help in that too.

Talk to people, volunteer and donate to AAP.

All the best! >between age group 15 to 25 as they are most open minded

BWAHAHAHAHAA. Talk to people and you'll understand that cunt-vision is not distributed uniformly on the age spectrum. Anyone can have cunt vision. Most people are a product of their immediate circle and the content they're fed. They rarely question.

>I will give them facts, convince them

Humans do not trust facts. They believe good stories. Become a storyteller. Write good propaganda. Spread that. [deleted] Kejriwal as PM? Many other options than him. Assuming it's a new person everytime (i.e. nobody is informed about AK by two different person), it will take log₅50,00,00,000 ≈ 12.445 ≈ 13 days. You haven't yet met the Bhakts, have you? You're way2dumb if you think you can convince billion dumb people.
 Democracy is a utter waste of time. 

It hypothesizes majority thinking = correct thinking. So fucking dumb. I don't think liberals support Kejriwal anymore since he supported abrogation of Article 370. And nationalists already support BJP. So, chances of him becoming PM is next to nill now. People don't want facts. Now they want muslims to be taught a lesson. Not sure you can change that unless you have the kind of money bjp has... to the tune of thousands of crores and at least a whole generation to work with. RSS has been working on hindutva propaganda for decades and only now it has started to show results with the money they've amassed. You'll also take decades to wipe out all the lies from public conscience. I had read somewhere about the 3% rule, it says that if you want change you just need to convince 3% of the population and the rest will be a domino affect. 

I don't know if this rule is scientifically researched. Why don't you look it up and act according."
Politics,"Shiv Sena Calls For ‘Compulsory Sterilisation’ of Muslims, Again [Dec. 2018]",121,e2e98i,https://www.thequint.com/news/india/shiv-sena-saamna-editorial-muslim-sterilisation,68,,suicidethrw," At this point ideology doesn't even matter, ideology is a joke.

When BJP can ally with NCP and NCP+Cong can ally with Sena, I wonder why the people are so much butt hurt about defending their ideologies? Your leaders seem to have no problem in licking the other party's dick, then what kind of high horse are you even sitting upon? ""Final Solution"" Its not a coincidence that their abbreviation is SS . No they don't. From the same link you posted:

>The Sena had said: ""Sadhvi is not as educated as the Owaisi brothers (of AIMIM), thus may have chosen wrong words to convey her message. One can ignore her sterilisation words, but the fact is, their (Muslim, Christian) population and family planning remains a problem.""


I'm a Muslim myself, and I agree that Sena are islamophobic assholes. But I find it really amusing that in so many years when they were BJP allies, no one gave a shit about them. Now, all of a sudden, people are digging up whatever dirt they can about shiv Sena. 


Lest we forget... BJP is currently run by Amit Shah and Narendra Modi, the guys who arguably oversaw the most bloody riots against Muslims in the recent past. Pointing fingers to shiv sena is, frankly, an insult and a joke. ""live and let live"" doesnt apply to SS Yep. Its odd that everyone is remembering this now tho. I mean us muslims suffer bigotry thru out the year. But everyone is waking up to it when SS is becoming a party in power.

Now is when people remember Sanjay Raut's anti-muslim comments. where are you guys the rest of the year? *Indira Gandhi flashbacks* Good, now there is a check and balance so SS will not make these kind of absurd remarks (hope) Shiv Sena is a symptom of the diseased populous of India. The symptom exists, and thrives, because we are bigots; the majority of us anyways. Suddenly there are a lot of SS posts here. Are they organic or planted by the Troll army? > The Sena had said: ""Sadhvi is not as educated as the Owaisi brothers (of AIMIM), thus may have chosen wrong words to convey her message. **One can ignore her sterilisation words, but the fact is, their (Muslim, Christian) population and family planning remains a problem**."" Dekho karna kuch nai, kam se kam shant rahe ga jab tak alliance mai hai. I think good start one at a time. Honestly, I feel Sena+NCP+Congress is better than Sena+BJP. Lesser of two evils, rather. Ideally, the NCP and Congress can put a check on Sena's Hardline hindutva. Then again it could just be wishful thinking on my part."

Business/Finance,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",0,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",howdy_rss,
Business/Finance,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,347,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,114,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",badger991," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   [deleted] A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI. "

Not trying to be misogynistic here but this woman is a full-time liar! 2 years of RR were under BJP. 🤔

6 saal se majority mein sarkaar fir bhi excuses. Abki baar, bahaane maarne wali sarkaar. I know I know that’s why our country wasn’t even untouched during the 2009 world wide recession. Our growth percentage was 7+% and the 1991 globalisation by mms was also worst. You are so correct. How dare us Indians can allow Netflix and amazon come to India and let us enjoy our lives. We should be made to beg for our money like you all did remember ? But they didn't restrict withdrawal amount to 100 rs madam. The year is 2060, even after constant efforts of all our great Hindu leaders, we are unable to correct the damage caused by UPA government. But thanks to the great leadership of visionary Jay Shah in his fourth term, we are able to beat one district in NWFP in Pakistan in economic development. First they blamed Nehru .... 
I wasn’t a congress supporter so I blamed him too 

Then they blamed Manmohan Singh... 
I wasn’t a fan of Manmohan Singh so I blamed him too 

Then they started blaming me(millennials) but by then no one was left to defend me 

~Me writing a copypasta poem because I don’t have the balls to sit down and study Pichle 6 saal se ye log kya jhaat uga rahe hain? Bloody useless fellows. I'm done with BJP. When will they stop this blame game and accept something for god sake Madam ji so even your husband is anti National ? So when are you deporting him to Pakistan ? Absolutely the worst, since these sanghis couldn't dole out money to they corporate buddies for return favours. Your utter frustration is showing, ma'am! This eoman continues to show her lack of self awareness or brains We all know the last ones were bad, hence we elected you guys. Bhen f*****g c**d they are always in either election mode or blaming mode. does she even have an economics degree ? Bitch, please. Your ignorance and desperation is showing. All of bjp inclusively: no u Join me on the other sub.

Edit: typo Chal jhoothie What?!! Not Nehru?! If you can't cycle, blame the roads. Swarajya Mag published this statement as if she has won a war lol Isko ministry se koi toh hata do yaar....desh ko dubakaar hi chhain milega ise We always had full time finance minister's before 2014.

Under our great leader the Finance minister was always someone with a part time job. Nobody can say who was it without referring the internet. 

Now the Finance minister is a freelancer with no gigs. She blames the full timer's for the lack of jobs for her. Is she talking about Banks which store bull sperm ..... for holy cows. I mean... this lady is having a terrible go at this. Really you should give Kudos to beach cleaner Narendra.

He never faces a dual or fight. He hides behind the people he chooses to fight for him.

He chose FM not based on merit , he selects his minister based how much they can dish out crap.This against  people who question or come against them with a reasonable argument. The amount of shit these ministers throw , would make the sane and sensible person to leave the fight, thinking it is not worth to fight with a drunk douchebag he will probably drag you into the ditch.
Amit Shah, Nirmala Sitharam , Smriti Irani, Yogi Adithyanath..

Now let's see if Narendra can give one press conference on demonetisation. See comments like these make me think that what is the point of saying that we should have educated leaders. They are equally bad as the uneducated. All the difference is those people speak in bad language and these people speak, in clean English, but the same thing. ""worse"". madam ki english bhi kharab hai economics ki tarah. You guys are worst than Congress , Maybe she's talking about blood or sperm banks ? Lady Sambit Patra. Do you think she gets a full fledged script that some assistant writes before she spouts such bullshit.. Maybe we can, request that she carry color coded flash cards for reference next time.. You know for better entertainment.. Fun fact RR wrote 4 letters to modi regarding Nirav Modi's possible scam. This is RRs own statement. Why do they take names!? Makes it easier to prove false. Do it like modi, say ""unhe"" ""vo"" ""unko"" and things like that. Everyone just nods then. Remember how this sub was celebrating in the last general election. 

Gopal from Pandalpur remembers. Another attempt to discredit MMS and RR. Just to show that this government knows what they are doing and when they feel getting trapped they can always stir up some Hindu-Muslim shit. Disagree ""no u"" Still doesn't explain the state of economy at present The only waste produced by JNU . Living in denial as always, first blames it on youth for prefering Cabs and now Congress..

Business/Finance,Diwali 2019: Mark My Word Thread (and link to previous predictions),118,dnohi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnohi0/diwali_2019_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/,228,"First of all **Happy Diwali Guys**. Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Last years thread-https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9uxnic/diwali_2018_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/

Don't need to verify OP,  I have faith on my looks! Fun fact: This is the 5th year of the Mark My Words Thread!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I predict 5 more. Alright. Before next Diwali, I will get out of the rut I'm in. 

Get my degree. Get in shape. Lose my virginity. Read some books. Get fluent in French. Get a decent job. 

I'm serious this time. 

Remind me! November 13th, 2020 Abhi guitar 🎸 mujhe baja raha hai, tab mai guitar bajaunga. A resurgence in ""hindsight is 20/20"" type jokes. India will win >5 golds in Tokyo. I'll attend in person. I Will get one match on Tinder I would have definitely mastered the art of driving by next year Diwali, at least I hope I do. My digital marketing firm would be bigger than what it is right now and I'd get to buy/rent an office space I'll lose atleast 10kgs of weight. I would lose 15 more kilos. Would prolly work at my own or some friend's startup. I will still have no girlfriend Oxeam3 will not lose his virginity - Mark my words till 2025. I will get a job and a girlfriend next year I predict there well be at least as many false prediction as last year.

(only me so surprised so less predictions was actually true ? xD) By next Diwali, 


I will get an Internship at a good product based company or startup.


I will become a badass bald guy with an upper body like Frank Medrano's and legs like Ronaldo's. Katega I will either switch job or start preparing for UPSC


Rohit Sharma will become Indian Cricket Team's captain


Tik tok users will surpass WhatsApp users TATA will be most affected company due to economic slowdown, might decide to shut down since segments of Tata Motors.      
       
Amazon/Flipkart will be under radar of govt. Thanks to Mota Bhai, bcoz Reliance will launch e-commerce platform.     
       
Saurav Ganguly will join BJP.      
      
NRC purview will increase to multiple states. ""AAP will win Delhi 2020 election""
But I'm a NOTA supporters I'll get 99+ %ile in CAT in the coming year. Mark my words. Mark my word for 2020 -

* ""India will be superpower in 2020"" as predicted by our lovely ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam Sir. We are successfully failed in it.
2. India will make good efforts to promote electric vehicles and in green energy field.
3. Jio will start exploiting users like Airtel and Vodafone.
4. Recession will hit hard.
5. Government will close down or create problems in major PSUs.
6. MS Dhoni will retire from Cricket. I will become the main subject of a conspiracy theory. Going to get a much needed surgery.  
  
I'm going to finally move out of my parents home and get a job that's better than any of my batchmates. I'll hit the gym from next month and gain 10 Kgs. I won’t see Diwali 2020. Just a feeling.... I will do sincere efforts to improve my life I will be same next year.. Big Fat Bald Loser.. Rupee will hit new low of 85 to 1$ Priyanka chopra and nick whoever breaking up next year India will lift the WT20 2020.

I will finally get a decent job with good pay for sure.

I will fulfill my family's dreams. I will kill myself finally * Digital rights go further down the toilet, with blatant abuse of laws to ban whatever the government doesn’t want us talking about. 

* An marked shift towards Russian/Chinese style of surveillance; an attack on the intelligentsia. The government will manufacture excuses to extract details of donors to organisations/think tanks that oppose the national dialogue

* The blur between advertorials and actual news becomes so fine that people are exposed to propaganda non stop and don’t know it. This leads to an increased level of background casual racism that becomes more and more accepted. 

* BJP goes after opposition via Tax Man and the opposition eats itself like the fox from the Antichrist film and there is nothing left to oppose Modi-Shah

* Modi’s star wanes while Shahs rises. There is no major power struggle, but the writing becomes clear on the wall. 

* Water scarcity problem becomes dire and erratic weather wreaks havoc state by state, month by month. People become desensitised to the madness and uninstall PhonePe when it suggests for the umpteenth time to donate to CM flood disaster fund. 

* Internationally, nations become stricter with their immigration processes and increasing competition makes economic migration near impossible. Brain drain decreases, but in a market where cow piss research has more funding from Centre than biotech research, they are unable to contribute in a meaningful manner. 

* Amitabh Bachan dies. 

* I come out of the closet to my family, but they assume something is wrong with me. 

* Everything must burn in order to rise from the ashes. I will become superfit and get an arm tattoo. Definitely! Reduction in use of plastic and reduction in pollution. I will have a girlfriend (hope she says yes mah dudes) 

I will finally stop procrastinating and start studying again and get back my form

I will overcome my illness 

I will finally stop highlighting every sentence of my book because I don’t get what I’m reading. (Most important of all) I'll be doing an internship in summer 2020 and will have a job by Diwali 2020.

Good enough situation for PS5 I will get a job offer.       
I will learn French, at least this year properly.      
Récession will hit and it will hit hard. Will finally get serious about UPSC,  would have forgotten about Priyanka (or back with her). By next Diwali, I will have figured out this adulting business. I'll also have made up my mind about which path to take: MS in US, In India via GATE, or work at a top product co. in India. BJP won't lose any election except maybe in Delhi. They'll just show some ""slightly poor"" performances to convince people the elections aren't rigged.  I will overcome my 13 year old addition (I am tired of it). I will be  getting six packs. I will change atleast one Indian's life. I will learn  3 new things! [deleted] I will get a partner by Diwali 2020 More banks will fail. Get abs and build my legs stronger... I want to travel abroad, probably to Japan. But before that, I need a better career and need to resist the 'get married"" pressure from the family. Agle saal bhi lagra hai Single hi rahunga.

Business/Finance,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,120,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",Vibgyor_5," Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to. Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. 

I don't think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school. Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it. I don't understand this! You dad wants to start a school? Or does he want to teach?

Each of them are very different adventures! * Have you tried to find out what is motivating him to start the school? 
* Show him some examples of the ""risk"" associated with running a play school. Especially the legal risk (that could be deterrent to some).
* Assume he doesn't have other fall-back options (financial) for his own care/ medical expenses, then highlight that too.
* Considering that your Father has had considerable expertise in some field in the Govt sector, why not redirect him to a start a consulting firm in his core area of expertise? There are still area where experience matters, especially in Govt sector.. Don't support him financially right now, because you'll just be enabling him. Besides when he goes broke, you'll be one who they turn to. Show him Mota Bhais photo To be honest it sounds like he won't listen to you. I would suggest:


1) try to talk to him using numbers, charts, as someone suggested

2) speak to your brothers, get them to understand the financial risk, and get them to commit to supporting your dad when he loses all his savings

3) when the above don't work, speak sternly to your dad. Tell him you'll limit the money you'll give him when he burns through his. Prepare for everyone to get pissed off at you.


Unfortunately it's your financial future at stake. Everyone is going to throw kulcha in your face. Be prepared for this to become a big stink, and for him to lose all his money and for you to have to support him for the rest of his life anyway. But at least you would have tried, and can tell him and your siblings you told them so when they ask you to give up 40% of your income looking after him. If your dad wants to open a professional school,take him to see how one functions.After govt job in UP,he may have very different expectations of how work happens.Seeing a functioning one would give him context and feel for the entire project,instead of stubbornly dithering in the dark.  
If your dad just wants prestige he thinks he deserves cause of govt job,but didnt get after retirement,and is trying to manufacture said by throwing money around,abandon ship. He has to come to terms with fact that the time to throw money around has passed. I can think of two things. Either convince your dad or reduce his liquidity.

Your mother tried to talk with him? What is her stand? Can she convince your father to put at least some money in her name in non flexible instruments like NSC, PPF or tax free bonds, gold, small peice of land?

Would it be helpful to visit to a financial counselor who can point out how little 15- 25 lakh is to spend retired life?

Would it be a good idea to convince him to be associated with an educational institute for a couple of years and learn tricks of the trade?

Would he be willing to be associated with a NGO that works in field of education?

Can you try to talk to engage him with other people who tried education business but failed?

If everything fails, I think you should make it very clear that you will not support him financially. Whether you do so or not is a choice that you can make in future. 

Tread carefully on this last one. It will surely break his heart. You also risk to loose inheritance. I am just hoping that this will give him a shock and may be he will consider what he is doing. Ask him to take up full time/part-time teaching job in some govt school. No risk, impart knowledge, earn some pocket change and keeps him occupied. Let him burn it and when he is dependable on you, ruin his life witb many ""I told you so's"".

On a serious note, play school is not a very good venture to put your money in currently and its gonna br very hard to push towards profit and needs a lot of effort. So slowly do some research and shift it in your dads house buy out a share and be a 50% partner, talk like a businessman and tell him now you would handle it.

Then hire that coordinator and just give your dad a share and tell him to relax.

But make sure someone your dad listens to passes on all this to him, your dad seems to be one of those people who never listen to their kids. This is a general issue with Indian parents. They raise children as investments and expect returns from them when the children become capable (else you get labelled as 'nalayak' or 'kamini aulaad' by the society). They don't care about saving for the future, or about how they'll get money when it runs out, since you're always going to be there when things get hard. It's one of the pitfalls of a closely-knit rather than individualistic culture (but that's the discussion for another day).

I and my brother are going to be very set financially. I have an awesome job with amazing pay and my brother is in a very good college and is generally pretty good at what he does. However, I already warned my parents to not see us as investments which will generate returns and rather save for your retirement. I'm still going to help them if things get bad, but it won't be because they managed money poorly. As a result, they've started saving and investing money for themselves and aren't speculating real estate anymore.

I think you also need to do the same. Ask him how does he think he'll survive once his saving runs out. If he has a plan, good. If he doesn't, make it clear that you won't help as you've got your mouth full in a bad economy. MAKE THIS VERY, VERY CLEAR. He needs to be fucking adraid. If he still manages to get into a bad spot financially due to external factors, help him obviously. But this should stop him from squandering money.

If he wants to be nobel and wants to help, tell him to teach people at home for free or volunteer for free at a school or NGO nearby. There's a lot of help people can do with time rather than money. Why you do this op. Quit your job and help out your enterprising dad. You are lucky to have a dad who has this entrepreneurial spirit. Bc, you should help him reach his goal. This is the major problem with Indian society you don't support people who start a business. You need to help him attain this goal. 

A man at that age is having ambition is a rare occurrence. It's tells that he will have character and commitment. I don't understand why you judge that he won't succeed. You need to believe in him and his goal. He will do great , help him do great.

Business/Finance,GUYS I NEED HELP !!! Debt advice!!,19,dyxvph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyxvph/guys_i_need_help_debt_advice/,26,"I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

4) Financially what I'll be putting myself into by becoming the co applicant.",heretoaskquestio," First step before investing in any business, not just your Dads. 

Check the account books, This being India he would be keeping two books. One for official tax and the other to hide it. get access to both. If he does not have these details then please do not even invest a rupee.

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest. 

Third and the most important rule, **NEVER GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS VENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.** This is a risky place to be...

If your Dad has a Company/LLP, buy the MCA records of Profit & Loss & balance sheet to know where it stands.

I do not recommend you co-sign the loan till you view the old papers & the new papers. Slightly shady, but if you have access to your dad's phone, plus his PAN number, just generate a credit report from experian or CRIF. You will get all details of his credit transactions. If it's a sole proprietorship, is your dad liable for tax audits ? If yes then you can probably try getting his tax returns or opinion ( I knows it's hard without help of your dad) from his CA who did the tax audits for your father. 

If your father is not liable then your dad's business is a pretty small one try finding his PAN and login credentials to access the return he has filed to know the position. 

Tax returns and books of accounts don't really reflect the true position but it can show you the minimum value that a company is willing to pay tax on. May be off topic a bit,

Is there a way to know the loans taken by my father? Including CAR Loans etc."
Business/Finance,"I am tired of my parent's ""log kya kahenge"" (What would people say"" attitude while disregarding our finances. Am I being an asshole?",18,e4kaw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e4kaw9/i_am_tired_of_my_parents_log_kya_kahenge_what/,10,"I am a 26-year-old guy currently living in South East Asia. My father retired a year ago. My parents made sure that me and my sister have the best education. We studied in quite an expensive school and went to coaching institutes but ultimately it paid off since we both got into great colleges and I am now earning quite well. What I want to say is that my parents spent quite a lot in our education. They could have saved a lot if they didn't care but they chose that we study well and I am really grateful for this.

But the problem is that I feel that my parents seem to value showing off a bit more than finances. Since my father retired in 2017, he had the plan to start a property business after retirement. The idea was to move to a new house and later sell our present flat valued at close to 80lacs which would help start the business. The new house was to be built on a piece of land (around the same size as our present flat) that my parents purchased some time back. We didn't want to sell the land because the location was better than that of our present house so we decided to live there and sell our present house.

Problem was that my parents didn't have the money to build the new house. He had money but that won't be enough to build a 2 storey house and finish it. Why 2 storey? a) Because we thought that we would live on the first floor and rent out the ground floor. b) Because everyone in the area had 2-storey houses and it wouldn't look good if we had a 1 storey flat. We decided that I can help them in building the house. After all, it is our home and I would benefit from the property business too. I was working in India back then but my salary was good, around 1.6lac/month. Just mentioning this to give a clear idea that I was earning well so contributing wasn't a problem for me. 

So every month I used to give my parents around half of my salary. But since my father had retired and my sister was in college I had to pay her fees too. Plus I had a surgery and a good amount of money went into that. Bottom line is that at the end of the day I wasn't saving a lot of money. But I was fine since I thought that we would make up for it when we sell our present house and the new one completes.

Since I went to a top college and now work abroad and people in our neighborhood know this, my parents feel that our house should look good. Or people would think that how come their kid works abroad and they still have a sub-par looking house. Ok, I was fine with that. My parents have worked for me their whole life so I should not question these things now.

So I took loans. My parents wanted the latest fashion and interior design so that people are impressed. I must tell you that my parents have no money in their bank account at this point. Because they spent it all on the house. I think that their idea was that when we sell the house everything would be fine. 

Finally, the house was finished around May last year and I moved to another country for work. And I thought that it is all done. But I am wrong. Now my parents want more money for finishing and other decorations. I give them the money. I also feel that the money will come back at some point. I myself have a shit bank balance and loans too. At one point I had an urgent need to buy something and neither my parents nor I had the money to buy that. So I took another small loan. 

By this time I realize that my parents don't have any backup for a financial plan to handle an emergency or unwanted situation that we may fall into. They will either borrow money from their relatives or expect me to get it from somewhere. A couple of months back, the company I was working at ran into financial trouble and I lost my job and I was very worried about how I am going to pay the loans. My mother supported me a lot morally and I found a much better job soon. I really thank her for that.

It has been over a month at the new place and 2 days back I got my first salary from the new job. Today my dad called me asking for money for doing some more work in the house. He was very polite and not very confident since he knows that my finances aren't very great either. His statement, ""People over here would think that their son is working abroad and our house has some pending work left, so please help us in the next 2-3 months"". 

I was really pissed. But I don't want to say no. So I said yes sure. Problem is that our old house has not been sold yet. Parents have moved to the new house and have been living there for over a month. I know it won't be perfect but shouldn't they try to sell the old house now instead of thinking about what the fucking neighbors and his friends are going to think. I am tired at this point. I know that once the house is sold we would make a lot of money. But shouldn't they focus on selling the house instead of burdening me even further with these expenses? 

I haven't seen a decent bank balance in couple of years despite earning so well. I have loans in lacs that I need to pay back. There have been urgent situations when I had to borrow money from friends who earn less than me. Every month there is an installment I need to pay. And my parents give these excuses to ask for money. I feel bad thinking this way and for writing this post but I feel what would happen if something really bad happens tomorrow. What if there is an emergency or what if I lose my income source? Why are we focusing on decoration instead of trying to sell the house and let me save the money? I am really tired now. And my mom is very sentimental. I don't want to use the term emotional blackmailer because she loves me a lot and I can't image what would happen if she is not there to support me. But even she doesn't understand this. 

Am I the asshole for thinking this way?",desikid25," imo your parents stuck in what called sunk cost fallacy, they keep burning money on the pretext of everything will somehow turn right.

it starts with buying second house without selling and building enough reserve for expenditure on new one is plain stupid. sorry..

also forcing a working family member to take loans upon loans is another shovel to the dirt.

if you want to stop this, you have two ways, A. be selfish and refuse to invest further.. B. ask them, to stop unnecessary expence any further, but i doubt it why? because 'log kya kahenge'.

in any case take action sooner otherwise for them 'beta kama raha hai na..!' They might have given you the best and the most expensive education possible; yet they failed to teach you to say 'No'. NTA. If you are struggling with money and want to save up, communicate this to your parents. Tell them about the loans you have taken and the installments you have to pay.

Tell them you can't pay for the decorations right now and the next door Sharma ji can wait a few months to cherish the luxurious interiors of the house. Don't be a yes man, don't enable their behaviour if you face problems due to it.

Be polite, be thankful and communicate. I'm sure they will understand. Simple answer — No.

Simple answer, but in a song — ""*Kuch To Log Kahege, Logo Ka Kaam Hai Kehna""* Your parents' have what I call a lust for property. They'd find it very difficult to sell that old house.

I have a very similar story as yours. My dad had a government job and we used to get transferred all around the country. We had a private land in the outskirts in our hometown (a tier II city) where we built a 1-storied house which was rented and a government land which we got on lottery at a lower-than-market price. All our lives, we lived at half my dad's salary because the other half went to paying off the loans for the land and the house that we never lived in. When I got a job, my dad pushed me to apply for government land lottery in my hometown (because he couldn't buy it since he already had one) which I won and had to pay for. Secondly, my dad was close to retirement, so, we had to build the first floor of our house, so, they could move in there and give ground floor on rent. We could have easily sold the other government plot he had (which was small and far away from our house which was now in a good area of town). But, no, I gave away almost all of my savings for that and the renovation and the furniture and a new car and stuff. And this was despite me having a student loan that I was paying off on the side.

Now, I have no problems with giving my parents the money - after all, they brought me up and my money is their money and vice-versa. But, having  three pieces of land in a place where you need one place to stay and when the land prices have stagnated is stupid. The idea was to sell the other two after my dad retired, but, then he decided to build houses there because selling land + house is much more valuable. Now, this meant that his retirement money and my savings went into building a house in the first land (in his name) again. Now, instead of selling it, he has rented it and tells me that he's looking for buyers. But, I know that he has no intentions to sell because he had not put up the house on Magicbricks or newspapers or hasn't even informed our relatives who can help us hunt for buyers. Now, he's trying to build a house in ""my"" land where I will never stay - because of my work and career. But, instead of selling the extra house which brings in next to nothing in rentals, he is doing that again from my savings!

I feel that he has a lust for property. May be because he lived in rental properties or quarters all his life (he was born in a village, so, did not have an own house till he built the first at age of 50), he loves having multiple properties in the city and an SUV and looking rich. People from his generation typically talk about what their kids do and how many properties they have, and my dad feels proud bragging about all of this, in front of others. Even though it makes financial sense to sell the extra houses, he'd rather have me and them living hand-to-mouth with three ""bungalows"" (what duplex houses are called in my city) and multiple tenants sucking up to him than have financial security and one house of his own. Don’t give much thought to them. It’s you who has to bear. Whatever is reasonable do that. YOU start asking for money from them on some pretexts. do this every alternate month. start dropping hints u r into drug habits or something which is considered bad but not worst. this will put their minds at unrest to give u moral support and not ask for unwanted financial support from u.

i m not sayin to be evil but they need some lessons and parents dont take straights lessons from their kids. oongli tedhi karo."

I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai.

And fees is retardedly high. Students ki gaand maarte hai college mein. It's a strict school. Placements are quite good here though.  NMIMS would be the way to go in my opinion.  If you can go abroad, give it a try. 

Only, beware of the fact that one year master's programme from UK won't be recognised if you return to India.  Unless you are loaded don't go abroad for undergrad. Just not worth it. Study in India and go for Master's later. What's your current age? Acha ji. Well tbh I did my college around ten years ago, things have clearly changed since then.

Business/Finance,Will India embrace blockchain?,3,e8as8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,2,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy.

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

I'll probably put a tl;dr later.",zaplinaki," That was a very enlightening read, thank you for the detailed explanations and examples!

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client. I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too. This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

One nation one tax my ass! Yeah, to add to all this:

1. If you raise an invoice, you have to pay GST the next month without fail whether you can collect the payment or not.
2. If you're an SME, you have to constantly track whether the seller is filing his sales so that you get input tax on purchases
3. Make stupid e-way bills every time you send material out of the state and make sure they are the same as invoice

Bureaucrats make these rules on paper and flowcharts without having the experience to earn a single rupee in their life and make us go through with all this bullshit. Someone is doing more work than our Finance Minister. My CA was telling me that the government has some new regulation in the works that you have to use the sarkari GST software to upload invoices on a daily basis. He said it hasn't been put into effect yet. But if he is right, that sounds like a disaster for traders Very informative post, this is the kind of posts that make reddit india worth browsing 👍 Thanks for listing this out. IMO GST is the single biggest reason behind the current economic slowdown. And what you have listed is one of the biggest reasons. Somehow the taxation and MCA rquirements have increased manifold under the Modi regime but they are not being called out in the newspapers anywhere. The left is busy labelling Modi whatnot but they arent willing to go into the details of what is actually wrong.

The problem is that the congress/left started out by calling Modi suit-boot ki sarkar. Now they cant even turn on their blame because in reality Modi government is all about more effective taxation as much as possible. ALL of the Modi govt initiatives - Demo, increased MCA compliance, GST, angel tax results in more and more taxation - what they dont get is that in the process of making taxation more effective they have dramatically increased compliance costs for most businessmen and this is negatively impact the economy. 

Modi govt is actually more leftists than the left would like to admit. And because Modi is doing these leftish shenanigans, the left is reduced to calling him names rather than criticise him on policy and specifics. I don't understand GST that well, but I used to run a company in the past (pre and post GST era). It's still running, but I've moved on. 

Whenever we had an out-of-state client, we used to raise an invoice with IGST, as opposed to CGST/SGST split for in-state clients. 

Wouldn't that simplify the invoicing?

Like, the head branch of Tata Motors in Mumbai raising a single invoice with IGST to the head branch of Pepperfry in Delhi? 

As mentioned earlier, I might have got this totally wrong, as I don't completely understand how GST works with large organizations operating in multiple states working with several vendors spread all over the country. Looks like an excellent saturday read. 
Thanks you very my good sir. Will go thru it later. Thanks so much /u/zaplinaki for making this post and taking the time to explain in all these details.

Would you be interested in cross-posting in /r/IndiaInvestments ? You just get charged IGST if company doesn't have a office/GST in the state of receipt of supply.

We receive goods from Haryana and pay 28% IGST on it. Me: What did feku do in 5yrs

Bhakts: DeMo, GST

Me: neither of them are achievements

But peanut sized brains that bhakts have don't realize this. Nobody is coming here because this thread exposes that GST is fucked up. 

Feku can do only ""One nation one <insert new nonsense here>"" No tldr, nor read. It seriously is too long. BC my thumb got tired scrolling.

Bolo kaunsi chahiye 🤣 I did it. My wife is actually an ex Victoria's Secret model as well. I know of two such men, both my friend's uncles. 

They're both Muslims from Hyderabad. 

One uncle married a Gujarati Hindu (she had to convert). The wife is a US citizen. Her family has businesses in Chicago and this guy inherited those too. They have two kids. As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. 

Another uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage. She turned out to be very abusive. The guy was admitted twice to a hospital during the few years of their marriage. He has a son, so he's staying in the marriage for his sake. It's not unheard of when one partner is Indian origin person who got citizenship earlier. Infact, a close friend of mine got into an arranged marriage with a keralite girl with British citizenship and moved. It's probably more common among keralites though. They're experts in migration. That seems to be one nasty way to emigrate. I believe women might have more chances than men.

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Indian Shark tank? Wonder who'd be on the Panel 20 Rs ka coin? Broadband got dearer. Udhar Nofn ka mission chala raha hain. Policy confusion much? #No income tax for annual income within 5 lakhs: FM Corporate tax on companies with turnover up to ₹400 crore reduced to 25%.

Let me get this straight: Employer who has 400 crores of revenue gets taxed at 25%. Same employee of that employer may have to pay more than 30%.

Awesome. The budget lacked action. It had few proposals but majority of it was creating a vision for India. No big schemes or proposals So for people who want a comparison of how this budget is VS something from the MMS team, here’s chidabaram presenting the 2007 budget - http://www.moneycontrol.com/budget2007/pre_budget/Union%20Budget%202004-05.pdf?classic=true

I find that while he also says “there’s a plan for that”, he backed up more of his ideas with mechanisms of actions, cut offs to identify target groups, and specific budget allocations - at least compared to what I have seen so far by 12:10 IST. 

Let’s see how things change, and hope to be pleasantly surprised.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I’m not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

Edit: hahaha! It’s here! Debt raising!! This is the govt of spend (not a bad thing provided it’s accretive) 


What It’s now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that’s keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

Edit: the tax credit on interest is Decent. Doesn't budget usually takes place around February, why now? Since the budget is presented in English, for the MP's who can't understand English do they have translators who translate the speach in real time? No disinvestment in Air India She's pronouncing Tamil like she did Hindi. Rajaji would've been proud! Can anyone link me a good website or video to learn about tax?

Where you need PAN, you can just use Aadhar Card. The Swaccha Bharat mission got expanded to include Solid waste treatment, can someone explain its scope? Why is the minister speaking like this is an election campaign? Is every budget like this? Economic survey showed that rajasthan which relaxed the draconian labor laws generated about 25% more jobs than other states.

The current labor laws force small scale companies to not hire more than 99 employees.

This is because, as soon as you reach 100 employees, a large number of government laws and regulations come into effect.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

Literally zero hard numbers so far. This is disappointing in its predictability. What time (IST) will it start? What all reforms are you expecting? I’m expecting this budget to be something exciting this time. Will sadhvi also contribute to Gandhipedia which the minister is taking about? Did I miss the memo about Lord Basaveshwara? Nhb ko last saal pura 100% govt kia. Fir dekha gaunutra se kaam nahi baan raha. Send it back to RBI This just in: Taxpayers are the elephant in the room Fiscal deficit of 3.3% is starting to get into the high territory.

During the NDA 1 tenure, vajpayee government had made it a law to bring down fiscal deficit to 2% in 1 decade.

However both Congress and bjp government have shat on it every year without showing any serious intent to cut deficit.

We are not in a full blown recession yet so deficit should be cut more ""renewable"", ""carbon footprint"", ""environment"" being repeated many times, nice Car Sasti hogi kya?

Perhaps you know what the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is. If you don’t, let me explain.
 
(No, don’t be alarmed. It has nothing to do with that other Five Point thing. Calm down. Breathe)
 
There’s this thing in martial arts called the Touch of Death. In essence, it’s a technique that’s supposedly used to kill someone using quick, otherwise non-lethal force targeted at specific areas of the body. Shrouded in secrecy and replete with legend, the Touch of Death attacks pressure points in the body “to incapacitate or cause immediate or even delayed death to an opponent”.
 
Nobody even knows if it’s effective but let’s assume it is. Like air purifiers in Delhi.  
 
The Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is a type of Touch of Death made famous in the movie ‘Kill Bill’. In it, a person is hit on five different pressure points on the body. After the person moves and takes five steps, their heart explodes and they die. Gruesome.
 
I don’t think anybody is going to die, but last week, the Indian economy was hit on five different, crucial pressure points.
 

[Five blows fell in five days. India's business newspapers could scarcely keep up.](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BJk787lZDaABuyrHTQLzaoYlOwrndvdUlObe_UtMI3YVXmPSON9fOWgEcrbr6MNN6VWQ7M_jPzLsf8SWfq-xmkG0TA2DGGJIA_4cCn3Rytt_HSa3aIs5VqXVaRWQlUjzZfCgUqh7m7m7wijNDI3PSfylixMppT63nlnNoLDlon-JlZcFB5bELPcPri3TFaNbOfhP5K9QTlanAI8S45qh3bt78GWszx548kk1UXVbgC4b9wXqBNL096ZxWwbIark5pZHTFlzKvoaWQQvpzLZhT6m-CWY=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/bfde2eb287584a0f6c4724b91aa718235df52e77f4bb80dd161f6b8a67fdcd0be997d68cac3982e9c2d07902d0ebc98054b085b7ad7d30ffce6490ccfcd629fb.jpg)

**On Monday, the tax collection numbers trickled in**
 
The Income Tax department has a problem. It’s not getting enough taxes.
 
And it’s across multiple tax categories.
 
Corporate tax grew by just 0.5% between April to October as compared to the previous year. The plan, according to the budget, was for Corporate Taxes to go up by 15.4% as compared to the previous year. Of course, a big chunk of the shortfall is attributable to the corporate tax cuts that occurred a couple of months back.
 
Personal income collection grew by 5% over the same period, against the year’s target of 22.4%.
 
Direct tax collection touched Rs 5,20,000 crore (~ $78 Bn), which is just 39% of the year’s target. To meet the goal, the income tax department will need to expand its collection rate by 30%.
 
This leaves the I-T department with two options. Either get more aggressive with tax collections. Or ask for targets to be cut.
 
Right now, the I-T department is getting...mixed messages.

As Reuters reported,
 
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants them to collect 17% more in direct taxes this year as New Delhi seeks to shore up revenues amid a sharp economic slowdown. The target has been maintained even though Modi recently approved a massive cut in corporate taxes, which are part of direct taxes, and warned officers not to harass businesses in their drive to collect revenue.
 
Over a dozen tax officials interviewed by Reuters said they are stuck between a push to meet unrealistic collection targets, which influence their appraisals and transfers, and the fear of being accused of over-zealousness if they crack down on evasion.”
 
So what’s the I-T department doing, now that it’s stuck between a rock and a hard place?
 
On one hand, it’s getting creative with its definitions of what’s taxable. This week, they conducted preliminary enquiries to find out if they could levy a 18% GST (Goods and Services Tax) on CXO salaries.
 
I am not even going to try to explain the I-T department’s reasoning, but suffice to say, taxing income as a service is...a stretch, you’d think.
 
And lawyers agree. As the Economic Times reported,
 
“The interpretation adopted by the tax authorities is that an employee of an organisation should be considered as an employee of a particular office only (not the organisation as a whole) for GST-related purposes. Such an interpretation is legally and factually incorrect,” said Rohit Jain, partner with law firm ELP.
 
On the other hand, the I-T department is desperately trying to bring down their targets. And not by a small amount.
 
As the Business Standard reported,
 
“We are expecting a cut of at least Rs 1 trillion in the Budget target for direct tax collection to bring it closer to the ground realities. Economic slowdown has severely affected our mop-up, and corporation tax cuts have made the target further unrealistic,” said a government official.
 
So, a little bit of both.

**On Tuesday, the industrial output numbers were released**
 
How does one measure the health of industries?
 
The way India does it is through something called the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Just like a stock market index, the IIP is represented by categories like manufacturing, consumer durables, capital goods, and so on.
 
In good times, the index trends upwards. Occasionally, one or more categories may be down, either due to seasonality or due to cyclical demand, but overall, it’s usually growing.
 
In July this year, for instance, the index was up by 4.6%.
 
In August, it was down by 1.4%. This was an 81-month low. The thinking at the time was that this was probably an anomaly, and things would be back on track the next month once the September numbers were released, especially because of the festival season in October.
 
It was released on Tuesday.
 
In September, the index was down by 4.3%.
 
All thanks to one sector—manufacturing, which accounts for 78% of the index.
 
Why is this worrying? Because it’s clear that nobody believes this is an anomaly. Least of all, manufacturers, who didn’t even bother to boost production output before the festive season in October.
 
“September, the month before the festive season kicked in, saw production of consumer durables contract for the fourth-straight month. Production contracted by 10 per cent, up from 9 per cent in the previous month. The negative growth baffled economists who said e-commerce sales in October was very high and should have been on the back of positive growth in this segment.
 
Crucially, the consumer non-durables category slipped into contraction for the first time in FY20, with production thinning by 0.4 per cent. ""The sequential worsening in the performance of consumer durables and non-durables in September belies any hopes of a pre-festive restocking of inventories,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said.
 
To explain what happened on Wednesday, here’s Rohin.

**On Wednesday, an entire sector raised a flag of surrender**
 
Hope is a wonderful thing. It keeps you going in the face of adversity. It is so powerful that it can reshape the reality around you, so you see hope where others only see despair.[ Like Vodafone-Idea in India all these years, even in the face of quarterly results that looked like this.](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wRUWxgIhI3RAddBCCk4YzwZKw8Nk3RUSfg3dwL6DTzHkewpBfw51BrTRoQBBD_e6_p8prrSTEEpVLmnV1N56vFl4rY5Adu39Wt0ydJNTqu84l8sScPCmjRAGKfDzedF0xWUzW8w7gJP0O8H1cWkaHBYP8aGrMGPhjKnUBLexkDdjG0i1yCZXvtw1HCYlCcmiilNho7jSLCG1B-9L9aS0_OYc_92k_iiaipAkJP-I6JQYejc1QssaX-RVT1pO6Z9GwhZn3pgUrY_4UBmx9jXyKRmjRzA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c57f772ed4710fe5ad2873497cbe3b2aa68f1b8bfd08d75a992950304074479bc1759b013be1b8e1a9c11e058517342f0c35c1a1db222f2a1e4c7d0b07523c16.png)

But everyone reaches a breaking point. Reservoirs of hope aren’t endless either. On Wednesday, Vodafone must have realised that after posting the largest quarterly loss in India’s history. A loss so gargantuan that the axis numbers in the above graph, with added data from the latest quarter, [were no longer recognizable.](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XF7y_RPS_ljUaqF8FSIv_8hQ2D7GtA1TDqphEpOiZr0kRz-EohSG52OD55PJNCsPu5hNQG7-sCN1ArF2b4cuS9p4f5zTvE42Pz7InNkU3UJYGGBZSWWMAwxWnEuFqLZIcua4LXTqYtKw6IKmfPQ9fVYDaap_YZgWx-x0rmzliS0uuubBD_fRGJed7B_9ICA4vQ6f-JOt4K6QL29lMRumBVc1BoFRX3An6fvQzkYwc-zJIz1pV0fH2cL1gVLtabY0cAcxHUi94T98fqsg2eGWe5WRm5M=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c8c2d733c0c4ec3c5ea7bbfff69fc527a8d29779e7a2c48de26a6685493ad54c29c19dc6cd8d31770d565802dea5b2259753791c30d9acd376a8c4c429c37c45.png)

And that was how Vodafone, which owns 44.3% of Vodafone-Idea (27.6% is owned by Indian business conglomerate Aditya Birla Group), lost hope.
 
Vodafone-Idea’s loss was triggered by the imposition of a massive $4 billion retrospective fine demanded by the Indian government and ratified by its Supreme Court last month. (We wrote about it in depth in an earlier issue of The Nutgraf). A fine that came atop existing debt of $14 billion.

At a press meeting in London, Vodafone CEO Nick Read threw up his hands.
 
“Financially there’s been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and on top of that we got the negative supreme court decision.
 
If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical. If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario -- can’t get any clearer than that.”
 
A “going concern” is an accounting concept that assumes a private company has the financial resources to continue operations for at least the near future, usually at least 12 months. A company that does not believe it is a going concern is usually headed for operational disruptions, fire sales of assets and finally, a bankruptcy.
 
Thus, CEOs do not kid around with the phrase. Certainly not CEOs of global corporations like Vodafone.
 
In India, the mood in Vodafone-Idea’s finance department must have been funereal when they added the following lines to the latest quarterly results.
 
“It is to be noted that our ability to continue as going concern is dependent on obtaining the reliefs from the Government as discussed above and positive outcome of the proposed legal remedy. Pending the outcome of the above matters, these financial results have been prepared on a Going Concern Basis.”
 
This is company speak for: we’re drowning, and if the government doesn’t throw us a life preserver, we’ll be sleeping with the fishes.
But it wasn’t just Vodafone-Idea that was revisiting the concept of “going concern.” Bharti Airtel, India’s second largest private telecom operator, told stock exchanges it, too, had doubts about its future.
 
“This represents a material uncertainty whereby, it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, and accordingly may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.”
[
That’s after Airtel’s quarterly earnings graph became this.](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/IZQwUkAVdxQZbPTcYwouDQrfEZndZQS6xJ-fo2kYYWfd2mVijNyMatuUiSpTRofLx1B0z_V0ID2OPzOFsfaLdIFQ0_GNjEIQw5izl081CHb334vgH1T--141J2xwPwHVdLA8miyezCuRZkAq8gM3or0UedJaaz74UajtylyBupI1X4BOBfUOSIWCKQ8zVcM3On5AauGUM7aS0z6fCh1x5azJMHBfXBz0N2_nvqa4M2USmvUrTEikiyGYz5V7WdyoXflyBICA5gSZFOl7BnNmuVk-3aI=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/a64851dea9f82b76766d206656f405e40e3b4e486fa662f0415d6cf11b007830fd8506c75c95ec5b7704130e3a90b0c06d9bc780f6497dd79cd8e720119b2eae.png)


With 2 out of the 3 private telecom operators in the doldrums, India risked turning back two decades of progress in telecom, argued Sunil Jain in the Financial Express.
 
“The other reason why Modi needs to listen to Read is that, once Vodafone Idea shuts down, India will be back to where it was in 1999 before the Vajpayee government ushered in India’s telecom revolution.
 
Prior to 1999, there were just two mobile services providers; while Vajpayee ensured unlimited competition was brought in, India could once again have just two players, RJio and Bharti Airtel (apart from BSNL-MTNL, provided the merger and VRS results in a viable firm). In which case, the government/Trai will be back to monitoring the industry closely to guard against cartelization, rigging prices and stifling innovation; each tariff plan will have to, once again, be cleared by Trai. Most governments and regulators attempt to increase competition to ensure the industry grows well, the Modi government will preside over the death of two decades of competition.”
 
How did the Department of Telecom, the government department charged with “formulating developmental policies for the accelerated growth of the telecommunication services” react to this distress?
 
First it said, Oh, we’re still working out the numbers, but Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel better steel themselves for another 10% increase in their retrospective fines.
 
Then it requested the Supreme Court to prevent a merger between Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices (now defunct), because it wanted another Rs 8,000 crore (~$1.2 billion) from Bharti Airtel. The merger it was objecting to took place in October 2017.
 
Things ended on a good note though finally, with Vodafone CEO writing to the Indian government to proclaim that he is confident of the India growth story and that the country remains a key market for his company.
 
Vodafone meanwhile wrote down the value of its 44.3% shareholding in Vodafone-Idea to zero.
 
Then came Thursday.

**On Thursday, the inflation numbers came in**
 
If there was one thing that was working in the Indian economy’s favour, it was this—inflation was on the lower side. In fact, it had been declining slowly and steadily for years.
 
That ended on Thursday.
 
As the Economic Times reported,
 
India's Retail inflation for the month of October breached the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018 due to higher food prices even though RBI had predicted that food prices ""are likely to moderate as winter supplies enter the market"".
Inflation is said to be a tax on the poor. Which in itself is bad enough. But there’s a bigger problem.
 
The good thing about keeping inflation in check is that it gives the RBI a very useful weapon to combat a slowdown—rate-cuts.
 
With inflation going up, that weapon gets blunter. And difficult to use. As the article quoted above goes on to say,
 
The Uptick in headline inflation and its subsequent breach of the Central bank's medium-term target might push RBI to put the breaks on its rate cut cycle in the next MPC meet that is scheduled for December 5.
 
To summarise the week so far:
 
Prices are going up

Industrial output is falling

Tax collections are down

The telecom sector is on the verge of collapse
 
Then came Friday.
 
When things went from bad to...bizarre.

 **On Friday, the consumer expenditure survey results came out...and went away**
 
So there’s this organisation in India called the National Statistical Office (NSO). This is a government organisation that’s a part of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
 
The most important thing the NSO does is to go out and collect data. Periodically. Data about income. About consumption. About many other things. All of this data is used by the government of India to draft policy, design welfare schemes, target benefits, etc.
 
Cool? Cool.
 
So there’s one important activity that the NSO does called the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Every five years, it checks what people are consuming and where they are spending their money on. The last time this survey was done was in 2011-12. So the next survey results were expected to be released anytime.
 
It dropped on Friday.
 
Not from the government.
 
But was leaked by a journalist at Business Standard, Somesh Jha.
 
What did it say?
 
Read it for yourself.
 
Consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening rural demand, according to the latest consumption expenditure survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO).
 
Experts said a dip in consumption expenditure indicated an increasing prevalence of poverty in the country. The data set also corroborates a shortage of demand in the economy, driven by the rural market.
 
The lowest in four decades.
 
What happened next?
 
A statement.
 
“In view of data quality issues, the Ministry (of Statistics and Programme Implementation) has decided not to release the consumer expenditure survey results of 2017-2018. The ministry is separately examining the feasibility of conducting the next consumer expenditure survey in 2020-2021 and 2021-22 after incorporating all data quality refinements in the survey process”
 
This means that India will not have an estimate on poverty levels for nearly a decade.
 
Is there anything to be optimistic about?
 
Well, I am not an economist, but perhaps the last week was where India hit the bottom. Maybe the worst is behind us. Maybe the actions taken earlier will start to kick in.
 
It’s just one of those weeks where everything that could go wrong, did.
 
Next up is Sreedhar, about a city called Amaravati.

***Investments are subject to politics***

Here’s an interesting story.
 
Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, was to be an exemplar for city development. The state government acquired a large swathe of land to build a city from scratch. The state’s past track record, it has topped the Ease of Doing Business index for Indian states for years now, meant investors were brought on board, funding secured and a roadmap etched.
 
But then the Andhra Pradesh government changed. And with it so did Amaravati’s fortunes. The city was deeply associated with the flamboyance of its former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu. So, his successor, Jagan Mohan Reddy, chose to quickly and steadily kill projects associated with Naidu.
 
This week, he cancelled a contract with a Singapore consortium which was to build an exclusive startup area in the new city. He also trashed contracts with companies for a new airport, two seaports and a mall in the state.
 
Earlier, the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank withdrew separate loans totalling $500 million dollars.
 
A political powerplay affecting investments into what was to be a grand project could have a ripple effect across the state and country. The fickleness of India’s state governments means that investors will have one eye on a party’s political platform before pulling out the cheque book again.
 
And over to Jon, for our evergreen segment...

***Last Week in Softbank***

What do OYO, Paytm, WeWork, Didi Chuxing and Grab have in common?
 
None are profitable—that’s right—but there’s more. These are SoftBank Vision Fund unicorns that have all made unlikely forays into the Japanese market.
 
It’s no accident. SoftBank has a penchant for bringing portfolio companies to Japan, its home country and a place that its chairman Masayoshi Son has lambasted for an “underdeveloped” tech ecosystem.
 
“As I love Japan, I want to invest in Japanese companies but the reality is that there are no unicorn AI companies in the country,” he said at a conference in July. Unsurprisingly, a glut of Son’s Great Hopes have arrived—each entering through joint ventures with SoftBank, a move that gives the investor a greater say in operations.
 
OYO opened an initial 100 hotels in October; Japan is Paytm’s first move overseas—it claims 10 million users over 10 months; China’s Didi teamed up with SoftBank to take on Uber, a rival counts both among its investor bench. There’s evidence the JV strategy contains a dose of magic. WeWork—the struggling co-working giant that saw its valuation fall from $40B to $10B following a canceled IPO—is said to be close to profitability in Japan. Yes, you read that right.
 
Now it’s the turn of Grab. But rather than a JV, the Southeast Asian ride-hailer has arrived in Japan courtesy of Splyt, an innovative startup that connects ride-hailing services to enable users to ‘roam’ between countries. We’ve written about Grab's struggle to become profitable, and it’ll no doubt hope that the sprinkling of Japanese pixie dust is both genuine and contagious.

Business/Finance,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory",7,dlf5x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dlf5x8/pakodanomics_olauber_theory_box_office_theory/,4,"So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.",spider143," First of all to the effort you put in. Kudos. And you have rightly observed. However most of our educated class still believes that we are doing great. The situation is far too scary then being showcased. Sorry that bhakts downvoted your post. Your instances while valid, are the truth, and not propaganda. 

Hence not suited to the average Indian's media palate. #SAB CHANGA SI"

Helpful post Great post. I think you should make it a regular feature and rather than posting all your suggestions in one big post, make it a monthly or weekly post where you focus on 2-3 good podcasts.

I find a lot of my podcasts from your first category, and my app is filled with so many podcasts that sometimes I get stressed out that i'm not able to listen to them. Also I'm not able to do multiple stuff when listening to a podcast, any suggestions on that front? SynTalk is great too.

Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,14,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,3,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",nosleepnomore," if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market. Then use those to change / upgrade jobs. I leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire - too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you / your circumstances in person.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck. Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Moving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle. Returning to India may not be of much financial benefit. Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here. Hope it works out for you buddy."
Business/Finance,"People of r/india who are in the startup industry, is there any app/service/product developed in India which is making money?",45,akkv4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/akkv4y/people_of_rindia_who_are_in_the_startup_industry/,57,EDIT > My bad. Meant positive unit economics and profitability.,wildgoat," Any company that seeks VC money for growth focuses solely on scaling up because that's the whole point. Scaling up raises valuation that helps current investor cash out while attracting new investors. It's only after IPO do they think of making money.

There are tons of businesses that do not take the VC route and they make plenty of money. Zoho is definitely the poster child for these kinds of businesses. Wingify (VWO), as someone else pointed out is another.

I've heard that even Swiggy, even though they opted for VC money, had positive unit economics until recently when Zomato launched their 50% off on all shit offers. Startup is not an industry, it's a company in any industry which is just starting out, I could startup selling doorknobs tomorrow and be profitable the day after or never. 

If your question is any app/service/product developed in India making money? Then there are tons of examples, but wait, are you saying is the company making money or are the owners making any money? 

Flipkart for example is not profitable, but the owners made a fuckload of money. All the employees seem to be making a lot of money and all the stakeholders made money when Walmart brought it.

The question remains who is not making the monies though. Ever heard of Zoho ? B2B software startups are closer to profitability than B2C startups. Fredhdesk , wingify ,fusioncharts come to my mind. SAAS companies are doing well financially. Others are on permanent life support through investments. Bookmyshow is an example of positive unit economics in the B2C space For Ola you can read [this](http://economictimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/ola-starts-making-money-on-each-ride-inches-closer-to-profitability/articleshow/64955093.cms) for Zomato [this](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/zomato-scales-fy18-revenue-by-40-to-rs-466-cr-losses-fall-almost-73/65904498)

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this."

Business/Finance,Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,76,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",baawri_kathputli," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :("
Business/Finance,Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,5,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,"By James M. Dorsey

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",donoteatthatfrog," There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL."

Plan ahead before doing anything new with your business.


Research! Research! I can't emphasize enough how important this is. Research your market, your industry, technology, and competition. 


Customer is king. 


 Never get into business with family/friends.  Start selling your product or service even if it is far from perfect. It will never get perfect. Failure taught more than anything.
1) No one is your friend or sympathiser. Everyone wanna there for their own need.
2) Finance is critical. Put everything in writing even 1 Rs spent.
3) keep walking. Baby steps are also good rather than not doing anything.
4) Read, learn, research, practice. Do all those things which help you to grow mentally to sustain business.
5) Only Sales Drive Business. So focus more on Sales. Check out these [https://www.startupschool.org/courses/2/lessons](https://www.startupschool.org/courses/2/lessons) "

> At Delhi's Ashoka hotel, the national convenor of the UP-based All India Muslim Majlis, Wasi Ahmad, told the SIT he had been fielding puppet candidates in state elections since 2002.

> Ahmad offered fake nominees for next year's assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.

> His bogus candidates would stand for the Rashtriya Awami Dal, another local group that he claimed to be running separately. The Rashtriya Awami Dal is designated by the election commission as a registered unrecognised party.

> Ahmad then explained privileges puppet candidates like his bring to their sponsors from their entitlements, such as permits for campaign vehicles and additional bank accounts to manipulate spending.

> The election commission has capped expenditure of candidates fighting parliamentary and assembly polls. The limits vary from state to state.

> According to the EC's online handbook for candidates, non-compliance to the ceilings could attract serious action.

> ""This is also a sport for me to help someone (the sponsor) win. His victory will be mine,"" Bharti said.

> His phony candidate would participate in campaign, but with a brief to eat into the support of his sponsor's rivals.

> ""He (the puppet) will use our party flag not yours. He'll have his posters everywhere and will have car passes issued in his name. But when he will move out to campaign, he'll discretely talk to people about you. On the face of it, he'll be representing his own party,"" Bharti said.

Jagan’s YSR Congress Party has complained to the Election Commission **that the party had fielded at least 35 assembly candidates with names similar to their own candidates.** For example. in Ongole constituency, Jagan’s party has Balineni Srinivas Reddy and Paul’s party has Balineni Srinivasa Rao as their candidate.

> If you think this is not confusing enough, Paul’s election symbol, the helicopter with its rotor blades, when seen in a smaller size could be eerily similar to the fan symbol of Jagan’s party. Add to that the fact that colours of the party flag too are similar.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

From the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns.

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

I have around 10 lac rupees saved.",nosleepnomore," You are making decent money and India doesn't really have the jobs or growth it used to.

Diamond trade globally is dominated by Gujju's, why not go up the supply chain and apply for management positions at customer facing companies. 

You don't seem very enthusiastic about your current line of work. You definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to take.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

You have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet. If you want to study in India, ISB is one such option. Do you hold a Thai passport? If yes, look into getting into the IIMs via the foreign student route. Much easier to get in than through the regular CAT Tell me which Indian dude gets paid 15L per annum like you are, at the age of 24? Guys with your qualification in india earn 1/5th of what you earn. Since you’ve saved 10L until now, which is a great amount of money for your age, you can do an MBA and a PGDM from a **top ranked university** under NRI quota for that amount. You’ll need a good number of years put aside for that, and then you’ll get jobs that pay above 10LPA in the beginning. After that, the sky’s the limit. I think you already earn well enough, and really don’t need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job. The Thailand govt cares about their country more than India does and I think you’ll earn really well staying there instead of coming to India. Lady boi ban ja. "

Business/Finance,What would be a better decision? [Serious],24,abqu80,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abqu80/what_would_be_a_better_decision_serious/,17,"24 year old male, working in a day job from 8 am to 8 pm. I come from a BBA in Finance background but have been working in a jewellery factory. 

I want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time I have. Programming so that I can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance (Note: I have zero knowledge about programming). Also, after reading several articles, they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent. 

My second option is to start an online business. I do not know what the business will be as I really haven't thought about it.

What would you do if you were in my position? Develop skills or start a side hustle? 

I make 50K a month and the expenses are growing exponentially. ",nosleepnomore," Bhai 8am-8pm is not a day job, it's slavery.

Aur programme ki jagah program karna seekhna.

Waise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai, and i can prove that. Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I’ll just add some information to help you make your decision:
Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

So sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?

there are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.

Not saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with."

About time.  1.9 Crore salaried people paid 1.44 lakh crore as tax

1.88 crore individual business paid 48000 crore as tax Health and education budget looks impressive, they improved from last time Health coverage for 50 crore people, moving towards Universal health coverage. Nice, very nice. [deleted] Those under 5L salary saying that they don't need pay any tax BUT should remember about CESS tax. LTCG is the most disappointing feature of this budget. RIP NPS. Universal health wow... they nailed it.  Special scheme to support UP, Haryana and Punjab for pollution control efforts, to reduce pollution in Delhi NCR: FM everyone is talking about LTCG no one is mentioning the 10% on divendends distribution by equity mutual funds

http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/market/budget-2018-dividend-distribution-tax-equity-mutual-funds/story/269421.html Is LTCG applicable on 3years lock in of ELSS? For the good of this country make everyone declare their earnings/income.

 You've already linked every transaction with Aadhaar via bank and mobile and electronic payment methods. 

If you knew what farmers(not the labour which works on farms) actually make in a year you might want to reframe the taxation scheme altogether. Bjp when it was in opposition

http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/Raise-I-T-slab-to-Rs-5-lakh-demands-Arun-Jaitley/article20756508.ece First reduce bank interest / FD rates drastically luring the middle class person towards Equity Mutual Funds as an option to save/make money, despite the risk, if he invests for the long-term. Then impose tax on what he earns from there too. Disappointed there are no tangible benefits to the salaried class. They are the one who fuel the economy.

Fucking hell. They don't have any manufacturing inside country and when I try to import it from outside ,they fuck me in the ass with customs. Fuck this fucking country and fuck this government Threw in AI, 3D printing etc to excite the nerds. This was a very disappointing budget from the tax point of view..
Finmin didn't even look at sec. 80 deductions let aside revising the tax structure..
Deeply disappointed.. From Twitter: 

Middle Class will now have to pay:

Goods and Service Tax.

Long Term Capital Gain Tax.

Income Tax.

Increased Cess on Income Tax.

This will make them fall in BPL category and hence will be able to avail all Govt Schemes.

Masterstroke by Modi ji. [deleted] Seriously not happy about LTCG. They could have excluded ELSS. Or maybe introduced 0% tax for all holdings greater than 3 years. I have a feeling this will have a bad impact on the market.   Tax Update : Payments in cash exceeding Rs. 10000/\- to be disallowed.  As a pakoda seller, chutney anyone? Middle class being shown the middle finger once again.


Govt never fears any backlash  from them because they  have the most to lose ,but they still aren't powerful enough to have their voice amount to something.


They have to pander to poor people to keep the votes from slipping and
if they don't appease the corporates they'll withdraw their funding.


Middle class they can afford to screw over. Nobody is talking about the elephant in the room.
  
In long term every one is going to get income tax increases because of the public healthcare program.
  
Take countries that have universal healthcare, I'll give you how income taxes look around the world.

+ Canada upto 60%
+ Germany upto 47.475%
+ Sweden upto 60%
  
Take any country that has public healthcare and you'll see tax rates that will make you cry blood.

Now one percent increase in cess might not seem like a lot. Look at how this will affect you in the long term.
  
More over majority of the health ailments are because of life choices and are self inflicted ailments.

+ Fucking drunk people destroying their livers.
+ Something about tobacco users and smokers getting cancer...
+ People eating shitty food and getting sugar and cholesterol... (Heart ailments)
+ Some idiots being irresponsible and having abortion... or having 6 kids for that matter...
etc.
  
Who the fuck pays for BJP's pet project???
  
+ The tax payers who already pay fuck load of taxes on their income and whatever they buy (GST)...
+ People who pay more taxes than their rent.
+ People who don't own cars...
  
Public healthcare is the worst idea ever.

Well take it in the ass and cough up the taxes or get ready to go to jail for not paying taxes.

Edit: Updated Germany tax rates. Immediate update on direct tax changes from the budget speech -

1.	Real estate – double taxation in respect of immovable property. No adjustment where 5% difference is there.

2.	MSME – Corporate tax rate 25% to companies having T/o under Rs. 250 crore in FY 2016-17. Revenue foregone Rs. 7000 crore FY 18-19. 

3.	Salaried tax payers – No changes in structure. Salaried taxpayer – standard deduction of Rs. 40,000/- in lieu of transport and reimbursement of medical expenses. 

4.	Senior citizens – exemption of interest income from FD / RD increased to Rs. 50,000. No TDS u/s 194A for this. Health insurance deduction from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000. 

5.	Rs. 1,00,000/- deduction u/s 80DDB for critical illnesses for senior and very senior citizens

6.	Payment exceeding Rs. 10,000 in cash disallowed for Trusts. Non-deduction of TDS would be disallowed @ 30%

7.	LTCG tax – Tax LTCG exceeding Rs. 1,00,000/- @ 10% w/o indexation. All gains upto 31.1.18 grand fathered. STCG normal 15%. Tax on distributed income by EOF @ 15%. 

8.	Increase cess by 1%. Total cess @ 4% health and education cess

9.	E assessment – to be expanded 10% LTCG on equity returns is with or without indexation? Are we just going to ignore the FCRA amendments again? 

> 
> The government has for the second time introduced amendment to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in the finance Bill, paving the way for both the BJP and Congress to escape legal scrutiny for receiving foreign contribution since 1976, the year FCRA regulations were introduced.

http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fcra-amendment-in-finance-bill-to-help-bjp-congress-escape-scrutiny-5049589/ Remember, in UPA's government's first term last budget, they gave debt forgiveness to farmers at a national level to win elections. The fact that NDA has not given into anything like that itself is a positive.

Budget overall is ok. More exemption for salaried class is good, LTCG is a non-issue with grandfathered gains. LTCG is there in many countries, markets will factor that in. The only change should have been LTCG at 2-3 years not 1 year.

Increase in cess sucks. Do away with all these cess and rationalize tax brackets and bring more people into the tax net. Tax farmer incomes for fuck's sake. Chud Gaye phir se salaried log Your worst fear is here!

LTCG: Gains exceeding 1 lakh to be taxed at 10% without indexing Salaries of MPs, President and Governor increased! http://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ub2018-19/eb/allsbe.pdf

No allocation for the much hyped health insurance announced today. It is just the meagre same allocation for the existing UPA health insurance.  IIT Madras will work on 5g and block chain  Direct Tax growth 2017\-18 : 12.6&#37;  Nothing but Schadenfreude when seeing actual rich people claiming that they are middle-class and whining that no government does anything for them.  Gobartatti budget for the salaried middle class.  If not for the huge spending on infra,  this was like any vanilla UPA budget.  Anyone with a taxable salary more than 10 lakhs is basically fucked. So 1.6 lpm, get ready for 1.54 lpm


EDIT: Double whammy if you had ELSS mutual funds. Get ready to pay additional 10% ""ek gaav may Raghu thatha"" - Arun Jaitley, 2018.  [deleted] Maro pakad ke. Well done on the National Health Protection Scheme (5 lakh for every BPL family every year!) but please don’t implement it by linking Aadhaar to BPL Families. God knows what a can of worms that would create. A BPL card should be enough.

4% cess for income tax payers along with no change in the slabs? Wow. Also 10% tax on Long Term Capital Gains and reduced corporate tax for companies making upto Rs. 250 crores (25%). Corporations need all the deductions it seems. 

If the income tax base rose to 8 crores, could you not give some relief to them by lowering taxes? Would have gotten better tax revenues with a wider base anyway.

Again, the Government sees the middle class as the silent pony to beat around with a stick.

good from a welfarist PoV I suppose

also the 3% cess is up to 4% for a consolidated health and education tax [removed] revenue from cess will cover the healthcare coverage. if everyone believed in satan you wouldnt need this sissy healthcare.  >Real estate – double taxation in respect of immovable property. No adjustment where 5% difference is there.

Can someone explain this? Thank you! Does new tax on LTCG imply that people will now try to ensure that they have atleast 1 Lakh LTCG / year, in order to claim max tax benefit? Rural Gujarat gave BJP the shaft while urban stayed with them, so now the govt takes the urban for granted and making attempts to please the rural.  Good Initiative for Senior Citizens!

http://www.financeminutes.com/budget-2018-for-senior-citizens-key-benefits-relief/ I work in fund management and welcome long term capital gains. Allowing people to ride secular bull runs without paying tax promotes inequality. Risk inequities is way overstates especially if you don't sell.

But the government should also remove all write offs except fully expensing capital investment for businesses and corporate.  Sensex has crashed Waiting for Pradhanmantri virginity hatao yojna. Everyone in the country to have a house by the year 2022.

Well, disappointed, but is it enough to vote for Congress in next elections? Aur gaand maar lo bhen chod. Cess increased by 1%. There is so much ignorance in this thread.

Okay first, the cess is already 3% now ... It's been 2-3% since more than 10 years ! And the cess is calculated on the tax you have to pay and not your income. NO, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES NOT GET FUCKED BY 1% CESS ON TAX.

Second, LTCG. Let's do the math. If you're to earn 1 lakh a year as capital gains and let's say you've earned 10% return in the year, that just means you have had 10lakhs to invest in stock market.

Someone who has 10lakhs to invest in stock market IS NOT MIDDLE CLASS. Middle class in this country is worse off than Cows of this country. Atleast they have Gau-rakshaks to protect their ass After everything is announced and available can someone breakdown the budget and explain everything in layman terms?

This will include secondary and tertiary healthcare.

This is some big shit. kudos 1 Class Mild aur 1 Rajni Gandha total 32 Rs ka milta tha, ab kitne ka padega ? Thanks for doing this :) [deleted] Standard deduction a beneficial for employees not getting many allowances basically lower middle class or middle class.

http://www.financeminutes.com/standard-deduction-back-budget-2018-relief-to-salaried-employees/ I know this will get downvoted soon, but someone needs to put this out.
A lot of people are saying/posting here how bad it is for salaried people. I posted this somewhere else a while back, and so posting again:

**Less taxes on salaries does not necessarily mean your take home salary will increase. Companies will just pay you lower (look long term not short term). Taxes on salaries are not taxes on individuals but taxes on employers.**

Please. People need to understand it. Less taxes on salaries will just give you more money in the short term. In the long term no difference.

Edit: But seriously, **if you are gonna downvote me, provide with a rebuttal. If you can't, you are contributing to spread of lies/false-information, pretty much like online trolls.** Just that this time you are at the receiving end.

Edit2: Some people think removing all taxes from salaried class people (like done for farmers) won't increase inflation. Salaried class people paid a total of Rs 1.44 lakh crore as taxes (source: http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/news/budget-2018-standard-deduction-of-rs-40000-on-income-tax-actually-amounts-to-just-rs-10000-benefit/story/269379.html). That much more money and inflation won't increase. Good luck with that.

Edit3: I will delete this post within 24 hours. No point arguing when no one is ready to listen. :)

Edit4: Had I just worded this differently, ""Higher taxes doesn't mean less take home. Companies will be forced to increase salaries."" no one would have complained. :P

Edit5: A similar thing happened during demonitization. All salary-class people hailed Modi as God, Modi finally took the long-standing revenge of the salary-class against all shop-keepers, farmers, business owners. Masterstroke by Modi.
When I tried debating, most salary-classed were like: ""Why should I care, I pay all taxes, all my money is in banks, why should only salary-class pay all taxes?"". Now when the demonitization induced slowdown is gripping the entire country slowly, that is when they realize how brutally naive their arguments were.

Edit6: Ravish Kumar also said the middle class should not crib about the budget when there other much more important things to worry about. Here: https://youtu.be/B8dM1MGxQFw?t=16m53s Meanwhile, Congress is leading in all 3 LS seats in Rajasthan.  What is this long term capital gains tax? Is it a part of income tax or its a separate tax which I have to pay even without having any income? Could somebody ELI5 as to why middle class or salaried citizens are fucked? What were the expectations of which were not met regarding them? More tax on salaried class. Education/health cess goes up by 1 % to 4 % Thread deleted?

Harish Damodaran is a brilliant analyst, so keep an eye on him. Income tax batao yar. Bore ho gaye. The National Health Protection Scheme is more ""Obamacare"" and less NHS. Like earlier governments, this govt has also placed the onus on the private sector. 
 Right now I have a deduction of 60k for vehicles, and 15k for medical. So I'll be paying MORE taxes with the 40k standard deduction The healthcare coverage he talked about sounds splendid - up to 5 lakh rupees per annum for everyone. I wonder how it will get so much funding though. Anand Mahindra Applause!

This is a very good initiative and deserves appreciation. 

Some suggestion:

- The current format brings attention but is not suitable to stimulate a discussion because of the wide variety of topics listed. Reddit works because each thread is about one topic (roughly put), and it attracts those who are interested in discussing that particular subject. 

- Instead of collecting everything in one single thread, I'd rather that the mods split them by topics into separate threads. 

- Personally, I feel the ""community policing"" model of reddit in general is failing because of vote manipulation by vested interests. (This initiative is a good example for this). 

- As such, I feel the mods here should be bolder - don't just help with the policing of the community but be more active contributors by becoming editors (or nominate or elect members from the community to be ""editors"").

- The task of of the ""editor"" should be as it is in any modern publication or media outlet - sift though the 100's or thousands of moderated content submitted everyday and highlight content that the r/india community should be more aware of, discuss and debate. 

- For this, the mods shouldn't be afraid to have more than 2 sticky threads on the front page. (In fact, personally I'd be comfortable with up to 5-6 stickies every day.)

- Thus stickies by community ""editors"" and the generally community contributed upvoted / debated content on the front page should make things more interesting here and also help more in creating harder to manipulate community with better content.

------------

Edit: On more thought, a simpler approach initially, could be to link to the relevant topic threads  here directly instead of linking to the news sources directly. While it would mean we have to click twice to read an article, but it would also stimulate discussion on the topic and address part of the problem I originally highlighted.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ₹600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ₹2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

Situation will only get worse. Don't worry. > The liquidity crunch has become tighter because it’s no longer as easy to do business. AIM Nonwovens sought refunds of Rs21 lakh for the Goods & Services Tax...

This bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.

Any potential solutions to this problem. there is fear among everyone.muslims fearing about religion based crimes, industrialists fearing govt policies, middle class fearing losing jobs. then there are idiot politicians who instead of caring about this are making absurd comments defying all logic all science. Unless fundamentals improve, there won’t be private investment . If the government cuts jobs, investment, the vicious circle is complete. A bit  related question : 

Since markets are down, will it be good to invest in some of the good company shares for long term ? The greatest trick thats been played on the common masses has been the trickle down effect. The government caters to the problems of big multinational companies, and big lenders and hoping that the effect trickles down the pyramid to the lower section of the society. Decrease tax rates for wealthy because it would somehow improve situation for the other 98%.


Fuck this shit. I want the government to fucking care about common people instead. Make policies that benefit the 99% instead of the fucking 1% that have been increasing their share of the pie for years now. Economy is better when there is better circulation of money. The fact is that once the rich sense a weakness in the economy, they pull out. They invest elsewhere or just keep it to themselves. It leaves less for the other 99% and that's what we are seeing now.

Companies don't want to hire people because there is a lack of consumers. People are unemployed or working on much lower incomes which means they can only spend on what's necessary. Youth are not going for higher education because there are no jobs to get with those higher qualifications. This is an irreversible event the effects of which will be seen for years to come. A section of a generation that is undereducated and has low job experience in their formative years, and it can't be reversed now. The colleges have closed down and that can't be reversed. Companies have closed down and that can't be reversed either.

The thing is that common man ki gaand me itna dum nahi hai ki wo bahar ke deshon me money spend/invest kare. Or in immovable assets. These actions are reserved for the 1%. If common man has some extra money, what is he gonna do with it? He's not gonna deposit it into swiss bank accounts. In the end, the guy is going to spend it here:

- Buy a car: automobile industry profits
- Buys a home/flat: Real estate and construction
- drugs/prostitutes: unorganised skilled labour(?)
- better food: Groceries, Resturants, Farmers
- Start a business: The whole fucking economy+ more jobs
- Gadgets: Electronic industry, shops + jobs
- Health: Healthcare, Better life for common man is also supposed to be a goal for a government
- Education: Better generation of workers. Greater skills. Education industry

We've seen the top down approach and it's fucked the economy and I for one am pretty sick of it. The rich have become richer and they don't give two shits about you and me. Humari gaand bachane koi bahar se nahi aega, this is real life not a fucking movie. We have to vote based on the policies of the politicians.

My father tells me that *Ese hi chalta aya hai, when Congress was in power they did the same and now BJP is doing the same. Same shit, different toilet. The government has to bow down to the demands of the elites*. Who says we are restricted by these two options. Vote based on policies not party lines. Unless we vote based on the demands of the common man, no one would give a fuck about the demands of the common man.

Jai Hind. Is ""growth recession"" one of the most unnecessary oxymorons in the English language.

Policy/Economy,"Delhi Government today raised the minimum wage to highest for any state in the country, after SC ruled in their favour. Almost 3 times as much as UP. Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.",279,dooafc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dooafc/delhi_government_today_raised_the_minimum_wage_to/,103,"Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

> https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-allows-aap-govt-to-revise-minimum-wages/article29817076.ece

Delhi had earlier removed more than 1300 contractors from working for the government because they were not paying the prescribed minimum wage.",kash_if," Whoa! I just realized how much less I was paid for my job. Internship is still a loophole Question: Do the employers actually pay such minimum wages? Not just Delhi, in any place. India has minimum wage? It is a good step. Although many unskilled workers' work is not documented and is paid whatever the employer feels like one would agree to work on. 

Currently, in NCT Delhi daily wage worker/ contract based/ dihadi majdoor / construction labors are paid around 300 rs /day for 10 hrs of work. 

So not much is changed however what has been done is commendable. Curious - how much merit is there to concerns of labour intensive businesses migrating to other states? This sounds good on paper. But **it is a good step if and only if the government has factored in whether the business industry can afford the additional cost.** This is why it is important to talk to the industry too. Otherwise, the industries will just move their factories to other states causing a huge job loss in Delhi. And the businesses who remain will be forced to increase their price to be in business making everything for the consumers in Delhi costlier. 

This will probably end up as a costly learning experience to the inexperienced AAP government - **if you side only with the workers it's communism, and if you only support the corporates it's capitalism**. And both these models won't work in India. That is why it is important to talk to both parties to understand each others problem, and then create policies that address them.

-------------

**Edit**: As an example of considering a lot of things when making a policy - free education for all sounds like a great idea. Until you factor in the reality that you then have to create jobs for all these educated people. And you would also drive down the cost of labour with so many educated people seeking jobs. This is why education in India (and other countries) is deliberately affordable to only a certain section of society or to the exceptional (scholarships). That is why education is only free up to the level our economy can accommodate (currently at school levels, as offered in government schools). This is why it is important to talk with every stakeholder when making a policy. Hopefully AAP has done this.

Depending on how strictly they are followed it can have direct and indirect effects on the wage curve. And I think the indirect effects is what the companies are scared of, because it cost them more. So they will try to find loopholes or have undocumented work done. Wow, I was paid 15,000 bucks for 6 days a week, 8 hours a day and I had an MA in psychology. Depressing as fuck. Also, we pay our maids way less than the minimum wage in Maharashtra, looks like. why won't they vote for them first free travel for women in DTC now this Highest in the country? I think Kerala has a minimum wage of 18000 , correct me if iam wrong I don't understand why this is such big news, the central minimum wage for unskilled labour in Cat A centres has been 15,184 per 26 calendar days of 8 hours each with 2x for overtime since April and it's expected to be revised again this month.

These rates are religiously followed by Central govt/PSUs for contract labour. The Delhi govt. is not even matching this figure.

Edit: the rates have been revised upwards since October 1, 2019. >	Comparison with some other states:

>Maharashtra ₹10411

I would literally have to fire half my staff if this was ever actually enforced. 

Regulations should be made based on what's plausible and enforceable. These 'best case' regulations are fucking stupid. It just encourages people to do underhanded shit. Now see industries shift from Delhi. 

Atleast this will reduce the pollution. [deleted] Kejriwal and Bernie Sanders are so damn similar.

Kejriwal raised it to around Rs 15k per month
Bernie wants to raise it to 15$ per hour My only disappointment during the election was that AAP didn't gain a foothold in other states in india. Hopefully, they can become the 2nd largest party by the next election after seeing the dismal performance from INC. 14 thousand is way too much"

Did you miss 150 years of colonism which existed till 1947?

India, as an independent nation and a free economy has existed only for 70ish years. 

Our economic policies have also been flawed for a large party of our history. Idealism, corruption and incorrect policies had pretty much shackled the economy until 1990.

Despite liberalising the economy later, we still had massive growths from 1990s onwards (the quality of the growth is whole another matter) The mentality is bad. Agreed. 
Development of a country is based on industrialization, income per capita, GDP, literacy and other such aspects, not history. So even though we have  a richer history, we lack in every other aspect. This is an Asian problem not an ""Indian"" problem, this is because our opinions are heavily influenced by our parents and the older you become the more conservative you get so your children too are conservative. I think many people in india have this kind of ultra conservative mentality because of our education system, in short, it makes people rote learn rather teaching them to think critically.

Also, in india still has low literacy rate of about 74% as of 2011 census. In 2011 census population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore), so we have about 300 million(30 crore) people who are illitrate in 2011, so the number illitrate people in india in 2011 is almost equal to the entire population of USA.

India still remains as developing country even after more than 70 years of independence can be blamed to bad govt policies, corruption, the mentality of people and the worst one being population explosion. 

To get an idea how insanely fast population of India increased : In 1951 census the population of India was 361 million(36.1 crore), in 1961, it was 439 million(43.9 crore), 1971 it was 548 million(54.8 crore), in 1981, it was 683 million(63.8 crore), in 1991 it was 846 million(84.6 crore), 2001, it was 1029 million(102.9 crore), in 2011, it was 1210 million(121 crore). Presently, 2019 it is about 1370 million(137 crore).

So since independence we have added about 1 billion people to this country. So we need a lot of resources just to sustain the existing population. Now to add insult to the injury, we also had, many bad govt policies, corrupt politicians, who only look for their personal gains, rather than focusing on the development of the nation. Not related to your questions, but add a space after a punctuation (period, comma). Its always Shashak  Sewak mentality still rampant in India . Judiciary , bureaucracy , defence , industry etc. ,everywhere you will find this culture . 

As long as we don't accept everybody equal , how can we expect our society to grow ."

Isn’t it’s too early to say this? /s I have seen more critical news from The Economist and New York Times in past 1-2 years than any other Indian news outlet.

My husband asked him, ""toh fir personal vehicles main bhi demand kam kyu hua.""

Silence on the other side. Government bus increased in Maharashtra directly by 5rs up from 25 to 30 after the results. Not just narendar chodi, but also the majority of bigots in India who support him/vote for him and defend his actions with baseless logic. 
They are equally to blame. This guy is illiterate, probably hasn't seen the world from the perspective of us redditors, and is just like an outlet for their bigotry along with rss propaganda. He tells people what they want to hear. He sells people what they want. People buy what they want.

They want him to trouble Pakistan, talk about Ayodhya temple & cows, do massive rallies abroad, but most importantly to generally piss off muslims/christians citizens.
 
He has been excelling in all of those. No no we are best economy^/s No matter who comes in power, as long as the IAS still make policies, we will have a shitty economy. * Bad exports policy. [Textile exports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/indian-textile-sector-losing-edge-in-international-market-citi/article29184896.ece), [software exports](https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/indias-software-exporters-may-lose-based-on-falling-incentives-and-rising-tax-rates/70743190). We are no longer able to compete with other nations in various sectors.
* High taxes on transactions. An example from the advertising industry is the [6% equalization levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy](https://cleartax.in/s/equalisation-levy) charged on online advertising expenditure (If you spend 100 rs. on ads on Google, Facebook, or any online advertising platform, you have to pay Rs. 6 on the ad spend, making it Rs. 106, an overhead of Rs. 6 on your business.). This has made Indian advertising businesses and businesses requiring online advertisement, incompetent in the international arena. If your expenditure is Rs. 100 on ads, you'll have to pay Rs. 6 as an overhead to the Indian govt as a levy, making the cost Rs. 106.
* Exorbitant GST rates on various services and goods.
* Ease of doing business has decreased due to increased filing requirements for corporations and small businesses.
* Quick to ban, but not quick enough to regulate. Example: Cryptocurrency ban by the RBI. 

There are many things this Govt. is doing right as well, such as increasing the minimum turnover required for a business to register on GST. However, a major policy overhaul is required to boost competitiveness against countries with relatively relaxed tax policies to bring foreign money into India.

Policy/Economy,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,163,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

Strategy 3: Make it easy for startups.

Strategy 4: Enable growth in existing Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

Strategy 6: Create a technology platform that enables startup and SME growth. 


 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ☺️ Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  "

Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. Today's India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

Now what we have is just shit and giggles I think after the end of this term Modi will have a hard time gaining popularity. Mody govt how to solve -- DENY Could anyone estimate how low the GDP will be if we had the old non fudged formula?? We chutiya Indians deserve such economy.. We all are bullyish in nature and we don't care about actual growth. We will make fun of your introvertedness and will laud extrovertedness of Modi even though he know shit. Though if you have said two words when the corruption was high in Congress, we wouldn't have given or even consider BJP. bjp didn't came bcoz of mandir and cows, but it came bcoz of people being fedup with your untolerable silence towards the shameful corruption

You were too much introvert and the current one is too much extrovert. No balance in between Sadhus are becoming CMs. What do you expect? The comments as usual are cancer. The job market is so fucked already, can't imagine how much more worse it can get C'mon now , someone should come up with solutions! Amd BJP govt should fucking accept it and implement it ! Nirmala Sitharaman's response for any question about the economy is acting all haughty and telling the finance secretary to answer it Oh so now he talks! If this man would have been allowed to rule unhindered from the Gandhi duo he would have completely transformed the country. Man, I miss the golden era of booming growth of the 70s. Overall economy - worldwide, has slowed down. But don't let that stop you from selective blaming and faux outrage."

Can you imagine the fury if they cancel this? All these people lost time and business/jobs for nothing. [deleted] Sc cannot intervene in each and every matter of the government. If can only observe and comment on it. If they start to intervene then what will be use of government.
Legislature and Judiciary have their own boundaries.. 10 more fucking days I don't think they can do anything more than give their opinion about it. Either way they're busy with more important stuff like forcing patriotism in movie halls. Is it killing the economy if a majority disagrees and would be willing to beat you up over it? Is a fact a fact if no one around you agrees to it?

Modi era has made me definitely more philosophical. Only when a judge from SC gets a lot of their money stuck due to de-monet. I think between SC and Modi, the latter is still wiser at the moment no matter what your standings leanings are. You might not agree with demonetization. But SC (judicative!) making the rules (legislative!) about national anthem is just unacceptable. The government (Modi) might have executive orders with temporary effect. But SC is totally insane at the moment. Honestly pipe down, it'll be over in 10 days, I can already see things normalising around me > Killing the economy at an astounding rate  
  
What is your quantification of economy and how is that being killed at an astounding rate?  
(Anecdotes don't count, since we are talking about a rate after all..)
   > It is killing the economy at an astounding rate.

Can you put some data to substantiate. Most economists expect a 1% growth hit at the max.  SC has no power as we have clearly seen. There is no proper separation of powers. This %hit continue Hopefully never."

**India Can Become Powerhouse Economy If Policies Managed Well, Says IMF** 

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!


^^^*only ^^^poor ^^^illiterates ^^^count.",Rocky_since1951," Apparently, 30% of the population is below poverty line. That is they live by dollar a day. A lot of time we don't see them because we live in a bubble. Your security guards and waiters mostly come from Bihar and NE. And there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do. Its the middle class that is getting the D in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged?  

>lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy\* by locking up the poor!  
>  
>\*only poor illiterates count. >Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months

Wrong fact.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people. Just see Chinese example, they didn't care about people opinions, they picked them from villages, provided them jobs, housing, medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty.

Though I am well aware this can't be implemented in India. Please stop being sarcastic in that way. Your intentions may be good but let's not make a joke out of all this. 

Poverty alleviation programs and family planning programs are already in place. Things hopefully, will get better. Hi,

So I feel the same way. You can't really change generations of class divide, however change yourself.

Treat everyone with respect. I say thank you and sorry to watchmen, chefs and Walters and try not to disturb them too much. Just be kind and understanding to all. Try not to dress too fancy all the time. Remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot, but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less. 

Try to live a humble life. Never waste food or try to do so if possible. Try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn't show off his or her money or parents money. Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work. Take your maid, auto driver, road sweeper, vegetable seller, construction worker, etc etc etc.. Just this evening, I am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it. 

PS: i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor, mostly outside big cities & towns, who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work."
Policy/Economy,Real Talk: India's economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,14,e5d76w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5d76w/real_talk_indias_economic_future_is_screwed_and/,8,"I'm starting this based on an assumption: that the only way for lower-middle income countries like India to prosper is through a manufacturing-led, export-oriented economy.

This is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This manufacturing can't be just any kind. It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.

It's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.

But this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. 

A few reasons why:

&#x200B;

1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.
2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?
3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.
4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems
5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.
6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.

I feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. 

Without manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:

&#x200B;

1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population
2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.
3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.
4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. 
5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. 
6. One the welfare dole stops, tens of millions of unemployed, angry, poor people will only do what they can do: revolt.

&#x200B;

Or is there a silver lining to this cloud?",mrfreeze2000," All popular grievances and administrative obstacles neatly outlined. Financial planners have been giving the government the call for course correction but the government is tone deaf to the problems of the common man. As long as Dalal Street is happy... Silver lining: a lot of these points you mentioned are low hanging fruit for Indian policymakers and industry. For instance, the attitude problem of Indian companies could change with experience, exposure and opportunities. Manufacturing country ship has sailed long ago. 

The future will be driven by A.I. and Manufacturing will be replaced by ROBOTs.

Take a look at any advance Car manufacturer. Lot of work is being designated to Robots and almost a skeleton crew of engineer exist to ensure products are checked to ensure they meet the standard. Also, know as Q&C(quality and control).

Job-like data entry will also be largely replaced. IT will exist for a long time cause they basically ride the code for a lot of these future techs. We will have a lot of Jobless people who need to be re-skilled to meet the demands of the future. We are an agriculture heavy industry. Another thing we boast is cheap healthcare. The future lies in these two sectors. 

Develop these and you are good to go for the next 30 years or so. 

I work in the biotech field. It's a highly niched field where very few products make it to the market after years of R&D. But biotech as such has a lot of overlap with this Healthcare and agriculture. Let's give India 4 years by then if the government and the population show improvement then well else only option left will be to move to some other place.  

Remember that you live only once. Am not gonna waste my time for people who don't wanna change themselves. If we can't develop a progressive mindset only we are to blame."
Policy/Economy,"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",52,cz0ctb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,43,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling",H1ken," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! In a free economy, people have choice to use either cash or electronic/ banking medium. Cash has its own positives and cons. Once printed, it goes through thousands of extra transactions with no extra significant cost. However, the electronic transactions charge per transaction. Both the system should compete, and people can choose. Cash shouldn’t be a dirty word. It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY’19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

Do people not understand that the majority of these ""funds"" will be spent on stock buybacks and higher bonuses? There are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economy.

Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut.

fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.",FlamingNostrils," **The ELI5 version for those who didn't understand OP**:

- Taxes are how government get the money to run itself. 
- When taxes are reduced, government revenue falls. 
- Modi *kaka* has reduced the taxes for his corporate buddies.
- The resulting [tax reduction (of around 27%)](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/corporate-tax-cuts-a-panic-reaction-to-tide-over-choppy-sensex-congress) means government will lose around 1.45 lakh crore in tax revenue.
- Now, remember that the government had forced RBI to give it 1.75 lakh crore to ""boost"" the economy""? 
- So effectively, government tax cut will cause a loss of 1.45 lakh crore, and RBI money will be used to make up for it.
- In effect, Modi *kaka* is using our money so that corporates can get richer and share their wealth with him so that he can continue to dress in style (through 15+ lakh suit boot ~~bribes~~ gifts) and ensure BJP remains the richest political party in India.

**OP's Analysis**:

- OP points out that businesses will just use the money from tax cut to shore up themselves (by buying their own stocks or giving bigger bonuses).
- OP points that the real problem currently is that people are not buying anything.
- Less demands mean business have to reduce production as people are buying less.
- Reducing production means some workers have less or no work to do.
- So businesses will reduce the work force.
- Some businesses will reduce salary of workforce.
- Net effect, there will be less and less money to buy things.
- Reduced demands means more business loss and job cuts.
- OP suggests an income tax rate cut would help with this.
- If people have more money in hand, they will invest and spend more.
- An income tax rate cut is one way to ensure salaried people have more money.

**ELI5 of ""trickle down economy"" concept** under which this big tax cut for corporate is defended:

- The ""trickle down"" economic ""theory"" claims that benefits to the wealthy trickle down to everyone else.
- These benefits are usually tax cuts on businesses, high-income earners, capital gains, and dividends.
- The theory says that only rich people can drive economic growth.
- So it proposes tax cuts only for the wealthy, and not a general tax cut for everyone.
- It also proposes that the cuts have to be big for it to work (based on [Laffer Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp) theory).
- It promises that the wealthy will use the extra money from the tax cuts to invest more, and expand business.
- This in turn will create more jobs or better jobs (higher salary).
- Thus, new jobs or higher salary mean people will spend more money and thus boost the economy. 
- This was applied by Reagan and Bush in the USA.
- During both the Reagan and Bush era, the economy improved.
- But Reagan had also increased government spending.
- Bush had also lowered Federal Fund rates (so loans became cheaper).
- So critics do not accept that the ""trickle down"" tax cut theory helped the economy. 
- They point out that during both Reagan and Bush era, inequality between the wealthy and the poor increased.
- The top one-fifth of the rich increased their income by 80%!
- The top 1 percent tripled their income!
- So instead of trickling down, the wealthy just became wealthier. Privatisation of profit and socialisation of loss. Bhai, simple. Chutiya people deserve chutiyi goverment. Abhi aagey aagey dekho hota kya hai. Bas koi bhi sector main government kuch announcement karde, raato raat sab expert banjayenge aur kahenge how this is better for us. Eg:  Demo, GST, abhi economy.

Modiji/BJP tatti bhi laake denge toh log kahega wah ye toh Amrit hai. BJP is comparing this to 1991 economic reforms. We live in a time when subsidies and loan waiver to poor is considered ""freebies"" and doling out money to corporates is considered essential for boosting business. The underlying logics are just bizarre! Govt don't understand the meaning of ""Reserve"" in RBI. These (Govt) are the kind of people who would tell you they can't hear you because it's dark outside. Well OP, you don't really understand or have never run a business. See, we have 10 lakh people coming in the cities looking for jobs **every month**. This is from agricultural displacement + new entrants in the workforce.

We fill about \~5% of that.

Now, we are surrounded by countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia. Each of them is growing YoY in **manufacturing** exports, women participation in workforce and GDP per capita **faster than India.**

Also, there is a unique situation in world trade where companies are looking to hedge their investments made in China due to a possible breakdown in trade relations with the US and China.

Any company who has to invest anywhere makes an excel sheet to check probable ROIs and compares it with their options. We had \~35% taxes while every single one of these countries had \~20-25%.

OP thinks because there is no demand for consumption, that's why there is a slowdown. **But how does demand arise?** Do you want the government to magically gift people money? People need to work to earn and save money. Money for a poor country like us comes in the form of wages and salaries from manufacturing. **They do not come through subsidies.** That road leads to Venezuela.

This move is not about bUyBAckS or dIViDEnds. They are still taxed (unfairly). **This move is about increasing the base.** 15% tax for new manufacturing units goes a long, long way. It has never been done in India before and it needs to be applauded. We don't even export as many clothes as fucking Bangaldesh. What the fuck are you talking about?

We are not rich. We are poor. We need capital. Lots of it. The **US has zero % capital gains tax for foreign investors.** This after being the largest GDP country in the world. Compare our attitude when Pranab Mukherjee made a retrospective amendment to tax one single company after losing a case in the highest court of the country. Lucid OP is lucid.

I disagree on reducing income tax as being workable in India however. Not enough people pay income tax or are eligible to do so. Doubt a reduction would make any difference since it would affect just a percentage of the middle class at this point. Most people earn below 2.5LPA.

The demand side issue at a larger level is not driven by taxation alone but (probably) low wages, too-many-bills, debt, stagnating rural income.

In my view, direct cash transfer using JAM should've been done. This ain't a bizzare world, it is just late stage capitalism Yeh govermint to tatti bhi Prasad samajh ke khilwaayegi. People's brains have been rotted inside out by the same brainworms that affect American conservatives. Even if you discount the clear chain of shitty budgeting between RBI and the tax cut, what reason could possibly drive salaried workers to cheer for corporate tax cuts? They would have to be insanely gullible or incredibly misinformed to believe the money's coming back to their pockets.

I'm going to sound like a tinfoil lunatic when I say this, but the sheer prevalence of the pro-capitalist pro-market narrative in India makes me think that thinktanks like ORF and Brookings are actively churning it out in ways that aren't quite visible to me (yet.) Is Modi our Reagan? Fuck. People are going to be unhappy regardless, so why give a fuck. Bhai, in simple words you are wrong in your understanding.

There are hundreds of up points of reducing corporate tax, at par with Asian countries. I'm celebrating it, but for a very different reason. 

As I understand it, it's not going to improve the government'*s* wealth. That's a good thing in my eyes, because lack of funds will keep a check on their madcap hindutva social misadventures like NRC. Was confused since a month wether it is a slowdown or a recession. The corporate tax cut just tilted it towards a recession. Time to cash out and run for the hills.... Hour will kaka get foreign funding for his party otherwise? Someone has to pay. >fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

None bigger than you.

These tax cuts were promised for ages.
They will not only help ease the burden of the companies but they'll also aid demand owing to lower prices when the benefits are passed on.

Don't rant just for the sake it, nobody is giving the corporates any money, they are just paying less which is good because the consumer then will pay less. Don't forgot the $1 billion in aid to Russia. Corporate tax cuts are a necessary step to improve the economy, but it's not the only step. This is widely backed by evidence. I would like to believe evidence based policies rather than mindless opposition or support, whatever may be the party. This is from Kuvera's weekly email. 

Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $20 billion plan to reduce the effective corporate tax rate, including surcharges, to 25.17%. This move comes in addition to the RBI’s interest-rate reduction to stimulate economic growth. Ms Sitharaman said that the new corporate tax rates would be ""comparable with the lowest tax rates in the South Asian region and in South East Asia"". Further, she announced a tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing units in the country that start production before 2023.
 
In the aftermath of this announcement, the S&P BSE Sensex and the Nifty 50 both rose ~5.32%.

There is sufficient evidence that shows that lower corporate tax rates have a direct impact on growth. Prof Rebello of Kelloggs and Prof Jaimovich of the University of Zurich studied the corporate tax rates in the US since 1890 and its impact on growth. They conclude that cutting the corporate tax rate spurs growth if the current rate is exceptionally high, an assertion which is true for India. Prior to the tax rate reform, we had one of the highest corporate tax rates in Asia and also globally.  Ab India ko Amrika Banayenge. > fucking idiots the bunch of them. And all you morons that celebrate this.

Is your objective feel better about your superior understanding or raise awareness. Perhaps a more softer positive tone would ensure your message is better received and goes further.

To be fair not everyone understands economics. Took a bunch of economists to condense the whole macroeconomics to reduce it to this simple statement ""Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut"" that you have written here as something very obvious

Honestly speaking fuck you. You're just a smug asshole who is angrily waving his fist at morons like us and feeling superior about your own understanding. It does not help anyone Source? [deleted] Surely all the reddit experts and right and the market which went up by about 1900 points post this announcement is wrong.."
Policy/Economy,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,721,czvagp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/,163,"*Transcript of the remarks by India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",firasd," What's particularly angering to me is that the BJP listened to all this and then came out and made a completely unrelated and irrelevant attack on Dr. MMS by calling him a puppet of the Congress leadership.

Whether or not he was, I fail to understand how that is connected to the statement Dr. MMS had made on the economy.

And then they went ahead and said that the economy is working fine under the Modi government. I mean like wtf? Then why did the RBI transfer an unprecedented 1.76 lakh crore to the government? Why did the Fin Min rollback some of the budgetary provisions to implement new ones? Why is your NITI Aayog leadership and the economic advisors to the PM affirming that there indeed is a slowdown? Why are core sectors performing pathetically? Why are factories closing up?

Matlab, chutiya samaj rakha hai bas. Literally lying to our faces. At least acknowledge that there is a problem! Solving it comes later in the process. [deleted] > Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

To me, this is the single biggest blunder The DeMo was big but one time blunder. Whereas, ignoring the farm crisis year on year is an even bigger blunder. You cannot say we have managed inflation by putting more than 50% of the population in severe debt and income crisis. That's not how you manage inflation. And that's exactly why this BJP govt has got the basics of economics wrong. And even now, I am afraid that all the subsidies are going to go to industries. Sure you can artificially increase the production and trade through govt intervention. But only for a limited period of time. Because who would consume what is produced when 50% of the population have had very poor income and are in debt. I really really hope that govt invests into the rural market. That is the need of the hour. But are they listening? MMS uses long sentences and uses big words like  tax buoyancy & elusive, he needs to put out statement in ELI5 format for folks in BJP to understand. If you need this as screenshots, 3 images here:  [https://imgur.com/a/l1YWSch](https://imgur.com/a/l1YWSch)

(if you need a non-Reddit link of the text, check my profile)

Useful to share when someone says ""oh it's cyclical, the global economy is slowing down"", etc.

MMS says it's a man-made disaster and I agree... maybe the UPA wasn't perfect and benefited from lucky market cycles (like the pre-2010 real estate boom), but all we've had since 2014 is pointless marketing campaigns with no follow-through like 'Make in india', 'startup india', etc, then self-inflicted wounds like Demonetisation, hastily-implemented GST, and all sorts of random regulations and taxes, including extreme margins for the govt on fuel (and businesspeople reporting increased harassment.) This is a misery. However, I salute Modi Govt. to have steered Indians and kept them away from realising these problems by giving them some other bullshit motives to praise him... like a Hindu rashtra and ordering some airstrike. He totally distracted people and still has them distracted from growing problems of unemployment..which was already the most serious problem during his 1st term.

You have to admit, NaMo is an expert at marketing himself and still keeping himself in power using things against the people of India which they like the most. Even among these problems of lack of employment, the people of India too (maybe not those who come here on Reddit, but still a lot of them) prefer  achieving a hindu rashtra rather than bringing something home to feed their families. It's not just NaMo, it's also the people of India. NaMo is just using this gullible nature to his advantage. 

And his propoganda...ooh la la...mamma mia....xD...all this fooling around with Rahul Gandhi being an idiot..well...to be fair...both leaders have said terribly stupid things in the past...but nobody ridicules the NaMo but pounces on RaGa instantaneously. Like seriously..you think we don't notice that there is no connection in totally ripping apart RaGa's political image apart and nobody touching you. Wow! 

This brings me to that airstrike...there was some terrorist activity and whatever action was needed to be taken was taken. Would've been done regardless of who was in power. And anyway, the suggestion to conduct an airstrike would've been suggested by the Head of the IAF, CAS; PMO just gives a GO to any suggestion. It was obviously beneficial to him looking how overtly patriotic our idiotic citizens were becoming. Another cheap thrill Indians love: Insulting Pakistan in whatever way possible. As a result...Indians loved this activity and there goes NaMo again.

And as a matter of fact...he steers the crowd so well, that these very people who had a twinkle in their eyes at the thought of 'acche din' have forgotten that those 'acche din' never arrived. So fucking awesome that a leader can do this. Last I knew somebody being this influential was Adolf Hitler and this is not insulting Modi. Maybe Forbes also named him one of the top most influential leaders of the world....but they don't know what kind of influence. 

You should try triggering people sentimentally by saying something mildly anti Modi on a primitive social platform like Facebook or Whatsapp...(some platform where a majority of this hindu-rashtra loving population is). The kind of blind love for NaMo and the immediate labelling of anti-national, endless hate, life threats, rape threats and whatnot: This is where you see the true India..the India that voted BJP in power.

In such a scenario, where the government and the citizens focus more on religion than actual livelihood of themselves, the people who want a better life are just stuck here. Best solution according to me is to escape this country ASAP and settle at place where your livelihood is not affected and you're away from religious wars and petty politics. Places like this exist, trust me. You just cannot thrive in India and cultivate a good ambitious career here. 

Maybe there will come a time where India will plunge so deep down this shithole that it'll have to press a hard reset over everything and start afresh. Maybe some day then it'll have a better and educated leader who'll actually take the reigns of this actually glorious country and restore it. Maybe maybe maybe. But this plunging and this reset is far from near....not happening 1-2  generations away from me since the current and all future contingents for this leadership are fucked up people. It'll take some more years to bring this country down just by virtue of it's volume. Since it is so slow, nobody is noticing... that's it.

This may be sounding a bit anti-nationalistic but I really think this is where the country is leading and there's no way leaders are mending their ways in the near future to steer away from this mess...they only know how to steer away from reality. Am I the only one who read it in his voice? He has ignored the fact that Hindu khatre me hai /s Legend When the country's majority is high AF on their drug of choice aka 'Hindutva', such important words of wisdom mean nothing. 

Farmers may be distressed now. The middle class may be bearing the brunt of Modinomics now. SMEs may be feeling the pinch now. 

But come elections, a military op against Pakistan or a perfectly timed resurgence of the Ram Mandir issue in the media or something equally manipulative would immediately turn these same now badly off, economically screwed dildos into loyal bhakts and they'll end up voting for the very same government which annihilated their happiness. *Again*. 

That's how powerful this drug is. Equally destructive is the epidemic caused by it. 

This drug, and those selling it, need to go for this self-inflicted fog of disorientation, chaos and self-destruction to lift. Actually, couldn’t agree more. Clearly the government is doing something wrong and it has to revisit its policies without appearing indecisive. and why have they increased the road penalties so much? Single biggest mistake of Indians was to elect NARENDRA modi as Prime Minister. As much as I like Dr. Manmohan Singh, it was criminal of UPA II to not impose GST under his watchful eyes. BJP and economics. Well, then why did they give Amartya Sen a Nobel prize for that? Any folks here in Economics and Finance care to elucidate on the situation - both for BJP and what our former PM is saying? O bhai! Yeh saari chize toh sanjay rajoura bhi bata deta. Koi solution bhi toh sunao manmohan sahib. There will be recession every 10 years because of business cycle. Govt cannot do anything. It is actually harmful to interfere. Nothing but opportunistic statement from Manmohan. It’s ok just blame us Chinese, we can take the extra hate.

Jokes aside at least u guys don’t see 50% rise in food prices [removed] I bet none of the numb nuts in the govt can explain the terms Tax Buoyancy, Jobless Growth and Nominal GDP. I agree with everything he says here. But without taking sides or calling names, interviews like this have lacked something people like me want to actually see; a solution. Of course, the economy is in doldrums, but Dr. Singh needs to shed some light on what this Govt. *can* do to improve this state of affairs. Politics in our country has always been about pointing out where either of the two parties has f\*cked up, with none coming out of any discussion the wiser. I know there are irreconcilable differences between not just the party ideologies but also within the voter camps, but the economy, like a million other issues, plague our citizens irrespective of their political beliefs. Desh ko bacha lo Sardar Ji we are fucked Okay we know what the problem is, what should be done now? Not like the general elections are around the corner. It'd be really great if people like MMS would help with the solutions and help the nation from this economic catastropy despite being from the opposition party. Thank you so much. I'm writing a thesis and using this speech, so you saved me tons of time! Vice chairman of NITI aayog on economic slowdown:. 

>stress in the financial sector has led to a slowdown in the economy, the Niti Aayog vice-chairman said the entire episode started with indiscriminate lending during 2009-14 leading rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) post 2014.
Rising NPAs reduced the ability of banks to do fresh lending, he said, adding the space was occupied by the shadow banks with credit growth of 25%.
The non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) could not manage this high loan growth leading to defaults by some of the large entities triggering slowdown in the economy eventually.

>It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent.  

This too could have been caused because banks had to stay back from credit expansion due to prolonged NPA problem. What do you think India will become in ten years - a kleptocracy like Russia or authoritarian state like Turkey? I thought if the the massive social subsidies under the NDA government continued we would have turned like Brazil. In a way then, it is good that BJP continues to be in power. They will reap the evils of what they sowed in the last tenure Agree with the points discussed here. Lekin sabne vote to BJP Ko he Dia? Kyun Dia? If not BJP then who else? Kaun banega PM ?

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Edit: If anyone needs help with any issues like job, education just message me. I would be happy to help.",ppcontentrobot," Awesome answer dude. You've put every point so precisely and there's no counter to any of that.

But, 'why would I come back to the place?' I'd give my answer to this. 

Because I am one of the few people who understand these issues.

Because I have power to solve one of these issues atleast to a tiny extent.

Because India sucking is as much a fault of the knowledged staying silent as that of the stupid ruling the roost.

(Bollywood answer alert!) Because it is my place! How many ever years I stay in any country, I wouldnt be considered as a localite. I wouldn't be able to say that this is my country. You said you are 28 and you have been in Germany for 8+ years, did you go there for your bachelors' degree? If yes, was the education free for bachelors'? 

Also, why doesn't Germany have a provision that parents of German(immigrant) citizens can also get German citizenship, like Canada?


Also, how is the treatment of Muslims in Germany, cause I heard the right wing is getting stronger there? Re Indian mangoes banned, it [was EU wide](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/fMXWwNQ0ZCL5ZjVAoGyhGI/EU-agrees-to-lift-import-ban-on-Alphonso-mangoes.html). There was also a ban on some vegetables which remained in place. Same reason: too much pesticide.

There have been similar alerts in [the UAE](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-alert-over-pesticides-in-food-from-india-1.191984) and even the Indian press has [published stories](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/chemical-concoction-pesticides-in-veggies-and-fruits-harm-hyderabad-children/articleshow/65126763.cms) about it. Indians feel like people owe something to you. Indians take things personally. Like a comment here, a service would be considered as help and refused. When a service is refused - you know what it means. 

Fortunately, a service isn’t interpreted as help and thus not refused (as much as it is in India) abroad. I’ve noticed this and that’s just my two cents. The mentality of the people should change. Hyderabad doesn't have GEZ fee .... Germany has 😂😂 Nice post and agree with you. Currently living in South East Asia and I always want to move to Europe because of various reasons but the salaries and the taxes always make me think. Interesting read, OP.

I am curious, what is the status of racism against brown people in Germany considering the fact that there's been a sudden inflow in refugees over the past two years? 

Also, how long did it take you to get fluent in German? [deleted] Hi,
As someone living in Germany for quite some while and familiar other parts of Europe as well, which countries do you see having well established or a booming IT/tech industry at the moment/in the near future? 


Also, in terms of quality of life, ease of integration/emigration, and racial attitudes, and in general the culture how would you rank these countries?

Asking because I'm looking at emigrating to Europe as an option and would love to know your perspective.  [u/ppcontentrobot](https://www.reddit.com/user/ppcontentrobot/), I wouldn't disagree with anything. You are pitch perfect on what's wrong in the country and I wouldn't blame you for choosing a better quality of life.

I wish I could just raise a wand and change the way things work in our country but unfortunately I just can't. So, I came down here and asked the world what's wrong and how we can influence change? Jingle bells, I wasn't cut out for what came back.

**If there is one thing I am sure of, it is of the fact that we just can't keep doing this forever.** 

Things around emigration will change drastically in the next decade and it will no longer be cut out for everyone. I wish we don't have to wait till we get hit to reform change. But you will always be a foreigner there and never feel truly part of the country, despite having citizenship, not to mention the huge rise in anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, which although brought about by mass immigration from Syria and Africa, will also threaten to sweep up well-educated foreigners like you.

The sad truth is India is destined for mediocrity, democracy is holding it back as it is susceptible to vote-bank  politics and nothing ever gets done.

China also has lots of different ethnic minorities (although not as many as India) and the reason they managed to do so well was because of an authoritarian leadership. 

India's inability to get a grip with the population explosion is contributing to much of this misery we will have the same population as China by 2024 despite only having 1/3 the land mass, we are extremely polluted due to this population density and it is said there will be a major water crisis in the future.

More than 50% of our population is in agriculture, this is completely unacceptable and farming should have been heavily mechanised by now and the people moved to manufacturing or something like that.



All this because crap politicians will keep their grip on power by gaining the votes of uneducated lower castes who can easily be convinced. The smart Indians will always view going abroad as the ultimate dream because they know India is beyond saving. Ok, it seems like you're having a really good time in Germany and your quality of life is extremely well. I'm happy for you for that. You've risen out of the struggles of India and found some peace and breathing room in a more stable place. Good for you. I mean that.

Now, is it possible for you to return to Hyderabad permanently and still find a way to sustain yourself and those that depend on you financially? Considering you're a techie, there is a good (enough) market for software developers here so I think that is possible. If so, what is stopping you from doing that?

The reason I'm asking this is because you seem like an above average and sharp person. You've also had experience abroad which a lot of people do not have here. With all that in mind, your perspective and passion will be invaluable and the same goes for your siblings. If you're this passionate about your country while staying abroad, imagine what you could do for your country, your city or even just your locality if you were living here? So why aren't you here?

One reason could be that you really aren't financially stable enough to shift here, and that's ok. If that's not the case then the only reason left is that your passion is misplaced. You are only worrying about your ""home"" because you feel like you *should* or because you have family living there. When in reality you've subconsciously accepted your new home in Germany. It's either that or something else that explains why you're not in India trying to help with these problems you've mentioned.

See, all I'm hearing from your post is ""Please make the city more livable"". A plea coming from a non-resident Indian who will never go through the difficulties of achieving that goal (because he doesn't and won't live here) but expects the locals to do so. And inshallah we will do so, but not to set up cushions for you but to furnish our own cities.

Your post implies that us citizens are wilfully producing and promoting this black, ""shitty air"" that you mention when in fact, just in case you didn't know, we don't want this air just as much as you (actually, we don't want it more than you because we have to breathe it every day). This, if nothing else, keeps us motivated to change that and since we *are* living here we can directly try to change that.

So you can see why a rant about our ""shitty cities"" can sound hypocritical to our ears when we're trying to fix things here and someone who has just about none of a dog left in the race tells us to ""make the city more livable"". It sounds very condescending, like a rich merchant asking the poor peasants to ""hurry up and stop being poor"".

We're trying.

(And when I say ""you"" in this post I mean to point to every NRI that rants about the ""situation in India"" but hasn't contributed to anything significant to help with it.)

> do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope.

I don't know why I wrote all this. You've said it yourself; you only want the good parts without having to have worked to remove the bad parts.

---

Also, I don't know why you're worried about coming to Hyderabad as a Muslim. I'm not the most politically educated but even I can tell you that Hyderabad is possibly the safest place for an Indian Muslim to live in (particularly a Hyderabadi Muslim). If you don't believe that then either I'm wrong or you've just proven how out-of-touch you are with your culture. But can you get chai from a tapari in Germany? 

From my experiences in Europe and Latin America, I prefer a life in India. Yes, it has its hassles, but everything is pretty accessible here, and affordable to everyone. I am not denying the downsides, but I would like to list out something that we want to overlook for greener pastures. 

* Nothing to boast, but I find the holiday structure of govt opportunities here pretty neat. And more public holidays. Private sector sucks, yes.

* I can travel 29 states, as diverse as Schengen nations. Just pack your bags and hop in a bus or train. You don't even need a car, even to go to the remotest part.

* No need for any language certificate to be anywhere or work anywhere, free movement.

* I don't know whether I would want to be another citizen

* I don't know about as many, but its pretty neat here too

* yup, no paternity leave here.

* exists here too

* Children can play with other children, and go to good schools as well. Might not be as extensive as there in curriculum, yes.

* I think you pay much more tax too, for social security, but way def a positive.

* Not great at infrastructure, but hospital and care are def good in my state.

The only place I felt like settling in was urban Brazil. Felt like a dev version of India with the most diverse and welcoming people I have ever met. It's easy to avoid dirt and walk away but it takes guts to step into the mess and clean it. Very interesting response.

Its your choice as to where you want to stay - Hyderabad versus Germany, but I want to ask:

1. What are the laws about spitting and littering in Germany? Did you educate your family and friends in Hyderabad about them?

2. Can you have religious functions in Germany shouting slogans in the street?

3. Can a mosque have loudspeakers blaring azaan 5 times a day? Can you set up a slaughterhouse on Eid and slaughter goats in the name of religion in Germany?

4. Can you stand and say ""I am an immigrant and a Muslim"" in Germany?

5. Did you know that the pollution you are complaing about comes from vehicles and people attempt to pay bribes to get PUC certificates? Try that in Germany too.

6. Can you get fake degrees in Germany like in Hyderabad? Can you come out after Friday prayers and pelt stones there? Can you tamper with your electric meter?

I have lived in Hyderabad and several cities in India. Yes, things are not hunky dory and perhaps lots of things can improve. Some of us are trying to improve, but you chose to leave and go away to Germany.

And that's fine. If you don't want to return to India in 6 to 8 years,  please don't. Just don't lecture us about how much Germany is better. Keep in mind that if the Far Right takes power in Germany, you'll be the first one demanding for a ticket on the flight back to Hyderabad. 

All of these luxurious things you mentioned are available in Germany because of under population and plentiful resources/jobs. That is how things were in most developed countries (US is a case in point) a generation ago. Once the population increases and competition for jobs intensifies, things will swing to the other extreme and quickly. Remember the country you are boasting about has a very bloody history of discrimination, and not too long ago either. Itna nafrat h toh yaha post kyyu karte ho? India should stop leaning into NRIs as Victims. Indians living in India are victims, Farmers, students, graduates, patients, average earning consumers. When will we stop catering towards whats happening to Brown looking people in America. 

I as an Indian living in India don't fucking care if you are fucked in USA. ""Dhobi ka kutta na Ghar ka na Ghat ka."" Your sorry ass will ignore this statement as well. So fuck you and your Anti India minds just to fill your purpose. Indians must and should never help you.

Our Indian Health care is fucked and has gone way down because Indian born Doctors in US study from India and performs a rectal exam of some white crack head hillbilly, just because his skin is White and beautiful. He never will chose to do the same for Indian sewer cleaner. The color makes a huge difference. Hence the health Care is worst and people in India die everyday unlike America. Cuz Indians are always there to cure White people in exchange of dollars.

Fuck your immigration issues. I'd rather have an hardworking illlegal Bangladeshi or Pakistani in India than discussing or worring about your sorry ass in USA or Germany for nothing."

1. Some people have preference for male child and they might using illegal methods to have a boy only. This will eventually lead to abnormal gender ratios
2. One child policy was implemented in China. It had some minor side effects on China's economy

So what about the two-child policy? will it curb the over-population problem of our country?",vj21oq," The problem is not how many children parents can have, but rather who are giving birth to children. 

You want people who are well educated and care about children to have more children, but since they put too much effort on each child they don’t give too many births. Those who don’t give a shit about raising kids properly have a ton of kids. 

Nigeria is self-imploding because of this. Japan and South Korea don’t have birth limit yet nobody is having kids, The main reason why 2-child policy is favoured is because to improve the sex ratio without causing population explosion. Our sex ratio(no of females/1000 males) isn't 1:1. It was 920:1000. So as to improve the sex ratio without causing population explosion the government favoured the idea of 2 children/family. For a brief period of time the government favoured 3 child policy, probably around 25-30 years ago but then it realised that it could lead to over population. We have over population problem. But our Population growth is slowing down not exploding. Just educate and empower women and let women decide on how many kids to have. Why should some Bureaucrats in Delhi decide that? 

Southern states controlled population growth without going for any specific population targeting. Bringing in any such population policy at this stage is a late reaction (because population growth rate is slowing down any way). We should instead focus on elderly care and lifelong education of people. https://youtu.be/cuSmqomszIA Yes I was planning to 14 kids We need get Sanjay Gandhi’s back.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis** 

 ______

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

Policy/Economy,Indian Economy.,41,di4hk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di4hk5/indian_economy/,31,"India's economy is going down which is a serious concern for all of us.

Where are we doing wrong? What kind of policies do we need to make things better? In which sectors we should focus on more than the other? How can we make our voices heard to the government?

Please refrain from making this thread a political one.",iams3n," Economy is political.

Ha Joon Chang says this in his book, Economics - A user's guide:

>In the old days, no country had a Ministry of Defence. They all had a Ministry of War because, well, war is what it really does. Patents used to be called patent monopolies, as they were (and still are) artificially created monopolies, even though they may be socially useful. So there you have it. Sometimes, an old, forgotten name conveys the essence of the thing it is describing much better than the modern one does.

&#x200B;

>The same goes for the old name of economics – **political economy**, or the study of political management of the economy. 

&#x200B;

>It is not possible to draw a clear boundary between economics and politics. This is because the very boundary of the market is in the end determined by politics and not by an economic theory – of whatever variety.

&#x200B;

>Before we even begin market transactions, we need (explicit and implicit) rules on what can be traded, who can trade them and how they can be traded in the market. All of these rules are restrictive in some ways, and therefore no market is genuinely ‘free’.\* And these ground rules cannot be determined by economic logic. There is no ‘scientific’ list of what should (or shouldn’t) be bought and sold in the market. The decision is a political one.

&#x200B;

>All societies keep certain things off the market – human beings (slavery), human organs, child labour, firearms, public offices, health care, qualifications to practise medicine, human blood, educational certificates and so on. But there is no ‘economic’ reason why any of these should not be bought and sold in markets. Indeed, all of them are or were legal objects of market transactions in different times and places.

I don't know what policies we should make. I would listen to people who have something to say about it instead of calling them anti-national just because they are calling a spade a spade. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a compensable past record on the sector they are focusing on. Sorry, but how can we make this thread a non- political one ?

If the government in power doesn't have a clue or is not ready to frame new policies how can we revive our economy? Centralisation of power is bad for economic growth. The local governments should be given more freedom to form their own policies for economic development. It is a must especially for a big country like India.

A small city in India or a district can't do much to improve its local gdp. The city council or the Zilla Parishad don't have the sufficient funds or freedom to do it.

However, an US city can attract investors by giving them special tax breaks or cheap electricity. It is the same in China. The cities of China compete with each other to attract investment. They also have sufficient funds to develop and maintain their infrastructure without waiting for the help of the state or federal government. See ,when uve got an  FM sharing Ola /Uber   Whatts app  based forwards ,..or a Minister of Law and Justice bringing out Movie collection's to show that the economy is blooming ..or when uve got the PM making constant claims of turning India into a 5 trillion economy at 5% GDP .. there's little to no hope ..get in educated Economists ,who'll chart an actual roadmap ..if not , this is a sinking ship ..and we're all ferrying on it ..🚢 The recession is not purely cyclical, it's systemic. It's kind of an 'Indian made' calamity. We knew it was coming, just not that it would hit so soon(demo, and then gst aagravated it and it hit us way harder).

The failure of major-scale capitalism in certain sectors was expected. The failure of our 'socialist' undertakings was also expected. People have been talking about it for years. However, since it's expected, it's was manageable and avoidable.

But that's where we failed, since we elected the current government which led to the major economic mismanagement which is going on.

Those who say that only the current government caused it  are not completely right. This economic calamity we see was a natural thing coming, but some decisions made without long term analysis brought it way too soon. This is where we got fucked. Economic cycles happen, structural problems happen, and people are paid massive amounts of money to keep track of it.


In short: we knew it was coming, we didn't know we'll manage it SO BADLY. And yeah, you can blame the government. In my opinion the government should take a 3 step approach to tackle sluggish demand and slowdown

Step1:

Disinvest Air India, MTNL, BSNL to start with - This will reduce the fiscal deficit burden

Bring oil under GST ambit - not easy - Congress perished taking consent on this from the states

1 GST rate(preferably between 5% to 10%) and simpler filing norms for all items, The confusion and the frequent changes has caused massive uncertainty amongst small and medium scale traders and businesses, the MRP on all items should be inclusive of tax

Step2:

1. Do not bail out firms like DHFL, IL&FS etc - Let them bleed, it would cause trauma for 2 to 3 quarters but the lending will be vigilent and risk mitigating measures would be taken once the firms are aware that they are on their own and the government wont be bailing out on them and repercussions might include jail-time


2. Reduce taxation from 30%+cess to 20%+cess for anyone under 50 lac salary - this is the population which really go out and spend since they aspire to be rich, wear branded clothes, phones, buy automobile, buy houses. This would also lead to more tax filings and can lead to increase in tax collection


3.   Focus on Agrarian distress and start redistributing the money received from disinvestment and GST collection without putting burden on the fiscal targets

Step3:

1. Focus on education - cut defense spending and increase spending on primary and high school education - increase teacher salaries so that it becomes lucrative for people to take it up as a serious profession and bring innovation in this sector.

2. Bring government banks and cooperative banks under the RBI scrutiny and not state and union governments which are prone to corruption and money laundering pre and post elections

3. Cut Interest rates so that home-loans are in the range of 5-7% so that mortgage market and the biggest stable and secured source of income of banks is maintained

4. Reduce dependency on oil import, this is putting massive a dent in our GDP and also it would protect the environment but this is only possible once we have better rail gauges, high speed freight trains and loading and unloading costs and tariffs are marginalized.

There are many other measures government can adopt but given the short-term 4-5 year goals, If I see atleast half the measures getting adopted, we will see a lot of poverty alleviated. You asked not to make it political. But the law makers and decision takers need to be economically educated people in the first place. I don't care which color they prefer, they should have at least a master's or a commendable past record on the sector they are focusing on. > Where are we doing wrong?

This recent interview with a former advisor to the govt. Pronab Sen goes into some of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na2WDrRif3M) -

*... Sen says that the government doesn't seem to have a game plan to fulfil the 5 trillion economy promise. He explains what the government ought to do to revive the economy– by prioritising growth and employment generation in the rural sector. Sen also assess two flagship schemes of the Modi government – Mudra Yojna and  PM Kisan Yojna in this interview.*

>> IMO, one thing we are definitely doing wrong is not defining ""we"" properly. I'd prefer a ""we"" that treats each citizen of India as an individual with potential, and then come up with ways to self-help as well as help one another rise into better economic situations. This could be through local entrepreneurship ideas and partnerships, meetups, training camps, volunteering, skill sharing, side jobs, investments, even emigration. Rather than be stuck in a salaried job totally at the mercy of company and government finances.  It's better to have a weak centre with 29 states each of which is a standalone liberal economic powerhouse like norway or sweden. The scope of ""we"" should be maxed out at state level, and then scaled down to district, city, town, area and individual levels with different policies at each level.

And not a ""we"" where somehow the central government and its party's economic goals are treated as a proxy for each individual's economic well-being. Where it's treated as a given that if central government reaches their $5T goal, it implies all 1.3B individuals have $3.8K income. I have always viewed all our governments and their employees as being adversarial and small-minded (redtape, bribery, influence-peddling, threats, etc) rather than supportive, and this particular govt is more so than normal. There's no point in ideating policies for central government's benefit - let them solve their own shit.  

>Please refrain from making this thread a political one.

Is it even possible? The economy is linked to politics. It always is. Filling all institutes with yes-sir men. They don't have the guts to confront the govt and ask them to take the correct steps. Manufacturing/Industrial output and wages.

This is what I would focus on. But I’m not in the government, so... It would be better if the government devises a long-term strategy rather than appeasing the corporates with the regular tax cuts hoping the investments to happen. India being an agrarian country investments in agricultural sector needs to be made the top most priority and, calculated and systematic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing sector should done to generate jobs. I think we are in for some  hard times. Reasons have been given by top economists, which our Govt refuses to acknowledge publicly.  How will it pan out, I don't know.

Having said that some sectors like white goods are upbeat and adding capacity, when auto and others are retrenching heavily.

You have to put more money in hands of people to boost consumption. Govt has to figure out how. Not an easy job and I think FM Nirmala Sitharaman is realizing  that now. And most of her colleagues are speaking bullshit.

Policy/Economy,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.",128,d6vb4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6vb4b/the_true_purpose_of_reservations_in_india_is_not/,54," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",conqueror_of_destiny," Do you think it is working? What I see is that even otherwise reasonable people get angay and resentful when they talk about reservation. I personally know a few people who talks about sc/st people in extremely bad manner. They weren't like this before entrance examinations after 12th. Now, whenever we discuss about writing PSC examinations, they are like 'Enthina? Kanda polyadikku okke kittum. Nammalu ezhuthiyikk karyamilla' Meaning: For what? Only low caste people(expletive) will benefit from such examinations and we won't get any benefit.

Another thing I have noticed is that these same people are getting more crazy about religion, especially Hindus. They feel that there is no one else to support them. So, reservations don't reinforce already existing caste distinctions in Society? Economic based scholarships would go a long way in alleviating this rather than reservation in jobs.

Once you have education in your mind, you get a certain level of self-awareness and self-respect. > The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse.

Ok, I'm a dalit. I've trying to learn about the history of dalits for a long time. Although what you've written seems like the dominant narrative. I think the truth could be much more sinister. 

In TN, where I live, the Dalit communities in ancient times still lived outside these agricultural societies. But there are several cultural practices, that would turn the idea that dalits were looked down upon. Several rituals in marriages and temple functions etc have a respectable role for members of these castes and receive their blessings. Some temple festivals start with the first ritual being performed from by a member of pariayar community. Then there's that sangam poetry which puts the paraiyar community as one of the noble communities. So there is a lot we are missing here.

But looking at the recent Y-DNA results and the cultural practices of the past. It's possible there was a shift in religious practices that resulted in the dehumanization of dalits. Dalits are most likely the descendants of the tribals that lived in the periphery of the cities. They lived in separate settlements because they are culturally hunter-gatherers. And there definitely was some mixing in the absence of a caste system. And they lived peacefully becacuse the post IVC agricultural societies knew they are descended from hunter-gatherer societies themselves and had hunter-gatherer gods such as Sivan and Murugan. 

The shift is the Sanskritisation of Tamil culture with the arrival of more vedic-leaning brahmins. I think there were other brahmins before who had integrated with Tamil culture and were okay with adopting local traditions. This could be one of the cause for the schisms that exist between iyers and iyengars in TN.  The beginning of the caste system and sanskritization of TN culture would have pushed dalits outside Tamil society in a power struggle for the cultural space of the Tamils with the brahmins winning. Today there are still remnants of this struggle. Lot of old kula deivam temples employ dalits as the priests out of tradition. 

So yea, in the last 1500 years condition of dalits have deteriorated to that of slaves. It just wasn't always like that. I'm a Brahmin too and yes I am not against the reservation but against the efficiency of reservation, my family was extremely poor and my father used to pull rickshaw and worked in a Hotel ( Included cleaning Hotel's toilet about 10 years ago ).

while I've seen abject poverty and with a family of five hardly managing food. In Urban area's most of Upper caste are never different from any other poor, even back in our village the situations have changed with hardly any opportunity  left .There was no government scheme that would help us. That's not just us but most of the relatives back  in the rural area.

Before giving my AIEEE and making it to an NIT, I didn't hardly ate anything for 2 days but water.

I remember my first day of college, where my room mate whose father had association with BAMCEF and grilled me for 15 minutes, as if I was going to discriminate his son. Ultimately he became a good friend despite his father brainwashing him when we parted from the college, to an extent that he admitted and hated the reservation system himself. Through years, he came to know about the fact that poverty strikes both Dalits and Upper caste the same way atleast in Urban areas. Dalits in rural areas no doubt have it worse, and even in Urban areas there is discrimination but it's certainly decreasing. His father was a professor in known college of UP, and he had a relatively cushioned life. Right now there is a generation of Dalits which has reaped benefits of reservation and are not willing to leave the same for the needs of the others.

Do you think the current reservation system will ever take out these communities from poverty ? there are millions of Dalits in Rural areas who will remain where they are because group of  Elite Dalits of Urban areas will keep reaping the benefits in a cycle.

>The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India.

If after 70 years of independence, if these efforts have ""hardly"" improved anything then don't you think there is something wrong with the reservation policies ?  By the current pace of improvements in life of Rural Dalits who are real victim, it's going to take 1000's of years. Back in the village a Dalit Family still faces a lot of discrimination, the situation in Urban areas have improved compared to that. The reservation should preferably be given Rural Dalits and then anyone else. I don't understand your blanket statement, a lot of communities within Dalits are now very rich and powerful, if we don't change the system this will be just another caste system.

>Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded

I lost my mother to Cancer 6 years ago, a lot of poor people do. We didn't had money to get her treated in a good hospital. Certainly again government won't help us under NHP schemes the budget were allocated for SC/ST. Some of them being not utilised. We wrote to countless bureaucratic structure to help us, so that we could use the same under as we were economically poor but we couldn't. She died in extreme sufferings. Is this the social justice that you are talking about ?Reservation system in India is deeply flawed and it's time we start talking about it.

&#x200B;

You write very nice things, but I don't think you've seen the poverty as a upper class poor or even Dalit for that matter. Ask them and they would any day leave their caste / creed / religion and be whatever you ask them to be. /u/conqueror_of_destiny While I agree with most of your text, the aim of affirmative action is not social equality(inclusion) but equal representation. AA does not aim to remove discrimination, but to provide representation to those who have been historically oppressed.

Anti-discrimination laws exist to ensure social equality, while social schemes exist for economic equality. Paisa hai to status hai bhai. Agar paisa hai to untouchable also becomes a valued best friend you brag about Yeah. It's sad and funny that a lot of people nowadays think the main problem with caste system is reservation and the small minority that ""abuses"" it. i agree to you. but none of these reason justifies reservation to person who belongs to family of a civil servant, doctor, rich bushiness man, (economically strong) families. \>Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India.

&#x200B;

1. How do you measure social opportunity?
2. Do you believe OBC reservations  are a evil\\necessary evil or are they justice?
3. Why do you believe ""justice"" against those not guilty of discrimination is not evil? 
4. What social opportunities are available to a lower middle class Jat\\Kshatriya that are not available to a Sr level SC govt employees kid and how does an IIT reserved seat help the kid get those? Correct me if I’m wrong. But wasn’t the original purpose of reservation to uplift minorities in a certain amount of years and then remove it when equality( economically and socially) for all people is reached but then every politician decided to just use it for votes instead of actually uplifting the minorities. Truth is their are not much gov jobs compared to increasing population of India. Reservation in job doesn’t matter much.

secondly talking about merit based admission in colleges their are not much good quality of institute apart from IIMs and IITs and few other.  and IITs are also not that extraordinary. so pro-reservation lobby must understand that all students from sc/st/obc generally are less talented than 50% of the class. and it is very likely they will remain below avrg in their Batch. only top 5% or 10% are winners at the end of 3/4 years degree. 
and people against reservation complaining sc/st/obc stealing their seats they need to under that even reservation is removed u won’t amount much. 

I see whole reservation thing as dividing India more than actually helping SC/ST/OBC.  
their was a reason ambedkar did not want reservation forever.  

disclaimer: I am gujju bania who passed 12th science on 6th attempt, never went to college, ran family bness and now am mining bitcoin at Iceland. I don’t complain about anything and I get what I want. Thank you for writing this. Also want to add how oblivious most of us are about the casual discrimination that happens around us. It's almost embedded in our culture. 

I recently went home and heard two phrases (that I had been hearing forever), but their connotation dawned on me just recently. Basically they were like ""what you acting like an xyz caste"" (meaning - you are being dirty or messy like a person from the said caste"". Second was like ""you are looking like an xyz"" (meaning you are looking dirty and unkempt, again like a person from the said caste). Needless to say the said caste fall under SC. 

These are phrases very commonly used (at least in my hometown). The person using this isn't really a bad/mean/casteist person. It was just so integrated in the whole culture that even though the phrases are outright derogatory, they are just normalised. The discrimination is just so normalised. Why not both? we want reservations for poor Dalits. Look up Nietzsche's notions of master and slave morality and the concept of *ressentiment*. Perfect comment man (or woman). It's a shame that so few of the anti reservation people even know of the fact that it's not meant to be a poverty alleviation scheme. It was always about social inclusion and for all its faults, real or perceived, it has performed decently at this. 

There's a reasonable case to be made for more subdivisions in the quotas though. There is class within caste as well for eg the Meena Caste is more educated and powerful than the other SC castes. Most of the benefits are cornered by them leaving the other people in the same state they were in before. Such type of reforms and A Creamy layer exclusion can be thought of. The creamy layer will not be based on the logic that economic upliftment finishes social discrimination but on the logic that the benefits of reservation should percolate more freely among the deserving. Thank you, you have done a good job. But it's not easy for everyone to look at this in a non-emotional way or rational way, I kind of agree to the other side of the argument too, reservation does causes some more division and anger, being from a OBC and not using any kind of reservation till date.

But I'm more in support for reservations than against it. Agreed Some of the other developed/more sucessful countries that have reservation that I know of : China, USA, Japan. There are probably more. I belong to a lower middle class sc family. Two of my cousins who got high paying govt jobs, wanted to marry their respective gfs, both of whom was from higher castes. Both the girl's parents said the same thing, that their community wont accept them after they have married their girl to a boy from lower caste. One of girl's family were from Delhi, so it's not even a small town problem.

I don't see caste system being eradicated from most of the country for another 30-50 years. I know people who got 3rd division in SSC and isn't capable of clearing an entrance even if you give him the question paper a month in advance complaining that he couldn't get in because of reservation.

No, son. You didn't get in because you are a fucking moron. Even with reservation the current supreme court consists of almost 95% Brahmins. Imagine the state of our other institutions and the position of Dalit-Bahujan-OBCs if there was no constituitonal guarantee for their education and power. We would have been treated like literal slaves in this Hindu caste culture/religion."

Since independence, we have achieved great growth and have lifted many people out of extreme poverty. However, this growth has been slow and patchy to say the least. Our current government is resolute however slightly clueless. Topics like economy, health, education are extremely tricky to solve for a massive and diverse state like India.

We need to create a repository of ideas, and have the best minds of the country (IAS, professors of national institutes, researchers, economists, students) discuss the ideas and assist the government in prioritizing which policies to implement.

I dream of creating an invite only platform for such people to submit and discuss the ideas and policies. I want our country to move away from discussing politics and religion. I want our narrative to change towards ideas and policies that can help propel this extremely capable nation of 1.3 billion people to a brighter future.

I have attached a mock-up of how I envision the portal to look like. Key features:

* Sign up using Aadhar OTP
* anybody can view the discussion but to vote, comments and engage you need to sign up
* initially invite only for the best minds in our country
* people can submit ideas
* ideas segregated in a manner our central cabinet is segregated
* politics and religion agnostic discussion
* No advertisement

I haves full time job however I am extremely passionate about India and this cause. I am looking for people who can make this vision a reality. I need people who can code, I can myself do the designing (photoshop) and assist with the setting side of stuff. I need people to help me in marketing the platform as well to top minds of our country.

Anybody who cares for this and believes in this, please comment and DM me

Open to hearing your ideas, and criticism",Wings_of_blade," Even though your idea is hopeful, i would suggest think this thoroughly. Why would any user search, register and engage in conversations. I don't see this product either market validated, User researched or monetarily planned.

The best minds are already doing their bits for this country, some are in R&D, some with businesses etc. The major problems i believe are with  bureaucracy, Lobbying and private networks. Which will need more than a web platform to have. 
Even in startup world, companies need 1-1 tie-ups for Sales and expansion hence the networks too. mygov.in exists. It  is an platform to build a partnership between Citizens and Government with the help of technology for growth and development of India. Point 2 is disconcerting me.you are talking about PSU's to share their productivity data (in terms of resource allocation,head count, revenue etc) with your framework.This would require large datamart to be created .then comes the bureaucracy hurdles. I hope your from IIM/IIT with good backing from reputable organisations or from private ventures OP here. These are some of the ideas/policies that I had jotted down in my notebooks over last few months.

1. Have increasing made in India requirements on retailers in the areas where Indian industry is already competitive, so that at least out competitive industries are not killed  - Zara, H&M, Ikea, Uniqlo, mini so, firstcry, etc textiles, plastics, furniture, chemicals and paints
2. Create a consortium of all state-owned energy companies (BPCL, ONGC, IOCL etc) and provide support to setup a world scale massive solar panel and EV batter manufacturing unit in India
3. Train workforce on a war footing - construction, textiles, metal work, wood work etc.  
4. Show ""made in country"" labels on amazon and every e-commerce website on product thumbnail. Govt. should periodically collect numbers from e-commerce websites about percentage of made in India goods sold on their website to see the trends. The idea is good, but what it lacks is enforceability. Once we brainstorm all ideas, them what. How do we get these things out in the field? Utterly brainless idea.

Does the govt not already have the top minds & experts with the right qualifications ???!!

And somehow some cobbled together portal can somehow collect a bunch of random nobodies to do a better job than experts who are already working on this day & night. 

Yeah we know the govt is not efficient in many ways & politics etc. But there is zero hope & no credibility of your motely crewn to be any better or have any influence over the govt.

Smell the coffee. The developer in me says that you should start with a reddit clone or hacker news clone from github and just mess around a bit. The realist in me says you are trying to use tech to solve a people problem, your idea would just generate some buzz (IF done right) and also need a massive backing from a ton of important people who would be ideally better of doing what they do best. is this trolling?"

Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,97,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

I've read the book called Nudge by Thaler. It could be a good thing if done right or it could be Orwellian if done wrong."
Policy/Economy,My views on the current right wing inclined folks today.,70,d7ormq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7ormq/my_views_on_the_current_right_wing_inclined_folks/,40,"I won't deny that I have never really inclined towards
 the right tor the left but there are certain things that I
 like more about each side. For example, the left
 believing in the rights of the LGBT community. But
 well, when Congress was in power, I was more on the
 conservative side because Congress really felt like a 
 ""pappu"" government in my opinion. I'm from
 Hyderabad, so, I never had to vote for Congress or
 the BJP and I'm happy about not having to choose
 one of them. Congress had some questionable
 policies but the situation the BJP has led our country
 into, I mean It's Outrageous.

 I've never seen Modi  commenting on the Unnao rape victim. I've never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation. He simply doesn't seem to care. Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi. Such is the impression that our beloved PM has on the international stage. I don't know, I don't see these Modi praisers talking about the economy at all. I am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called Modi has led us into this pit. I've never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level. All he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit. I am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslimcommunity's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities. Hell, I have so many Muslim friends, but growing up with them I've never felt the difference between my Hindu and Muslim friends. 

You see, with all these lynchings and forcing
 of Jai Shree Ram slogans has affected one way or the
 other. Before all this crap, we used to break each
 others balls, make fun of the religions and never got
 anyone offended. Suddenly, I look around now and
 we are still the same mates we were, but we think
 twice before bringing up a religious joke. That's what
the Modi government has given us. Everybody has
 the internet, everyone knows what's happening, this
 has to be addressed. Our country's economy, our
 secularism, our linguistic freedom, have all gone
 down the drain and when these right wing people
 talk about Modi as if he descended from the whitest
 clouds, it makes my skin crawl.",Travis_Bickle96," Unrelated advice: please use line breaks in your future posts. Gave up reading your post in a moving car. I'm from Hyderabad and I totally agree. I'm on mobile and reading your post seems like you're slightly left aligned Indian political line is completely imbalanced. You are calling yourself more inclined to the right and you may be correct in that but from indian perspective you are a liberal and left - wing or libratd from a rw perspective. Even in this sub where people represent themselves as leftwing doesn't support communism or they are more near to center of political spectrum . 

You can say that India political spectrum is dominated by right wing extremists with no left wing extremists to balance them. And extremism is always bad. I usually refrain for commenting on politics here apart from a few sly remarks here and there.No one in the Indian polity cares about the middle class general category students and job seekers.That's how I feel about it at 22.A conclusion drawn on the basis of my observation and analysis.The reason I don't indulge excessively in the clusterfuck of political discussions is due to this thought that  no political party when  in power would care a fig about us[Reiterating ki aadat] The cult of personality is a huge problem. I wasn't around during the Indira Gandhi era so I have no idea what that was like but I've never seen anything like this before. The supreme leader meme is real life now. Being a moderate hindu conservative, I have to agree. India has become extremely dangerous for people who aren't hindu. Heck, I a saw a reporter writing about how BJP is not doing enough for hindus. If you think this is bad, wait for the future. The BJP will go all out to create a surveillance state, in which all dissent will be crushed. They are already pushing for Facebook and other tech Giants to break their encryption. The case is in the SC, but when was the last time the SC delivered a verdict against the Government? 

Their will be elections, and perhaps they would be fair too, but because of the constant propaganda spread by the media and the government, they will win a majority everytime. 

Democracy doesn't die in one night. You don't suddenly wake up in the morning, with the Constitution gone. It happens bit by bit, piece by piece. Everyday you lose a part of your freedom.  Oh they banned Reddit, porn, Wikipedia? No worries, I'll just use a VPN. But there will be a day, where there will be no VPNs, no computers, no Internet, and no life as we know it today. 

There will only be leaders, and people who kneel before them. Somebody copy paste without those line gaps. Please. > Before all this crap, we used to break each others balls, make fun of the religions and never got anyone offended.

Same here. Earlier it was a joke, and it was understood among my circle that there were no malicious intentions. Now it all became real, or rather it was not 'real' atleast among my circle (young teens, 20s men). The same joke you used to make for fun, now you see a BJP retard saying it, whipping up a crowd to violence, etc. Dude format your post properly Bruh... edit this > Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi.

That was perhaps expected as the far left hates both Modi and Trump with a passion. I just followed her on twitter, hopefully more will do so and it'll balance out. The most annoying part imo is that there's no real sensible opposition party. Congress is a stale shitshow and other regional parties cant do anything. And dont even get me started on the communists. >PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslim community's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities.

So, if you hate right wingers so much why would you elect politicians like owaisi repeatedly? I guess you guys are too young to remember the glory days of the 90s when India was literally burning with caste politics, terrorism in Punjab, in Kashmir and Delhi especially was flooded with pandits who were refugees in your own country.

I was a little girl then, but I cannot imagine now what political instability and intense divisions that existed in society then. 

These are the facts: 
- None of Modi government's schemes have favoured one community at the disadvantage of the other. 
- The only exception to the above is Triple Talaaq bill, which is SC-driven, but there is no way this was being brought in by Congress (google Shah Bano case to see how Muslim women in India were set back into the stone age by so-called democratic/secular forces). This was to the advantage of Muslims in general.  Because what benefits women of a community = whole community benefit.
- Even demonetisation was preceded by drive to open bank accounts of the poorest. 
- There has been electrification of villages at a faster rate than the preceding Congress govt
- There have been subsidies on gas that have directly benefitted the poorest women. You probably don't know jack about cooking, so may not understand.
- My favourite part is the speech on 15th August 2015 re toilets, from the Red Fort. I have been a fan of Modi since then because I see a genuine drive to address basic needs of the people by this government.

I don't know why I am responding to your vitriol to be honest, but India has just concluded the largest election ever and handed an even bigger victory to Modi. If secularism and freedom etc were going down the drain, then you wouldn't be airing your opinion on this sub. 

The opposition leader literally called the PM a murderer/liar. You know what happened? Like any fascist dictatorship, he was.... challenged in the court, and lost. That surely is depth of fascism isn't it? 

You know whom I supported in Delhi? Kejriwal - because of the way Nirbhaya case was put in the limelight. 

What has he done for women's safety in Delhi? Jack. Don't tell me free Metro rides, because that's an election jumla which is not going to give any benefits. If it was then it wouldn't have been announced 4 years 9 months into his term.

What's more important than speaking from a podium about an issue is doing something about it. The Unnao rape accused has been arrested. 

But please contribute to this echo chamber more."

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government’s actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy—something long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country’s economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions—some of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming—especially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential—which some argue is around 8-8.5%—as the government’s spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over—indeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government’s anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework—exactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

“The deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI’s initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,” and then added, “We believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks’ balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.”

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

Policy/Economy,"Manifesto - of the people, by the people, for the people",7,e70sav,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e70sav/manifesto_of_the_people_by_the_people_for_the/,1,"Every election I see all political parties propose their manifestos - the things they plan to implement. These manifestos are mostly made by the respective parties in consultation with their party heads, which as everyone knows are filthy rich people, and who are most often disillusioned by the pains of the poor and masses. Hence, I do not understand why they fight an election on (false) promises they find suitable to make to us.

Instead, they should ask the common man, what to implement and what not to. But since that is not going to happen IMO, we should instead make a manifesto and ask them to fulfil our needs.

I have prepared a mini-manifesto by myself. I am a middle-middle class guy, so I may not be correct about the needs of some other classes like BPL, Lower-middle class or Upper-middle class. I may have also missed on some points and may have written less on some particular topic, kindly excuse as this is done by a single person only.

I have not written much in detail, specifically about Jobs and Economy as I am yet learning more about these fields. But IMO the points I have already mentioned will help in bettering both somehow.

Also, it may seem to some that I have proposed establishing/purchasing a lot of things, and it may seem like a drain on the economy. But IMO those are some basic necessities for the much-touted Super Power, which itself is a welfare state, to begin with.

One more thing I want to address is that I staunchly believe in HIGHER TAXES for Billionaires and Millionaires. As Bernie Sanders says, ""Billionaires should NOT exist"" when half of the population finds it hard to put two fulfilling meals on the table.

Further commenting on above, I believe all natural resources on earth belong equally to each human, and not only to the ones 'privileged' enough to reap monetary gains out of it. I think no one will disagree that a Billionaire doesn't work more than an employee of his/her company. He/she just happened to make money by making others work for him.

And from the little economics I have read, even these rich people need poor, middle-class people to buy their stuff. If the current trend continues, poor will not be able to afford their products which will eventually end up lowering these billionaires wealth. And all the people advocating for Capitalism, kindly look at the USA. Capitalism has sucked it hollow. Millions do not have homes, they sleep in their cars. They survive on food stamps and pay $2500 to deliver a baby. Student debt is at an all-time high. Rich are getting richer, true but for how long you should ask.

Policy/Economy,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,14,di5x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/,17,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",ohdickens," I remember, in the early 90s, my cousin brother endeavored to start a toy manufacturing company. It took a year and half to get all the permissions regarding land usage and taxes.

When he finally got to the stage of producing toys, he was already in losses as the interest for the loan kept pilling up (He had taken loans for machinery, which lay idle for a year, as he could not get permissions for manufacturing). When he finally started, he had to price the toys higher to offset some of the increasing debt. 

But then, if you remember, extremely cheap Chinese toys flooded the market (post-liberalization) and he had to declare bankruptcy after 4 years and close the company.

All because of red tapism.

This relates to point 5 of yours. I believe it has to do more with the Indian capitalists rather than to do with capitalism as such. 

Indian capitalists such as Nirav Modi and Ramalinga Raju who had successful business empire yet resorted to illegal activities. Sure there are illegal activities everywhere such as Enron scandal. But Indian businesses are too profit oriented, they treat their customers like shit. Before the entry of MNC in India, many Indian businesses had no policy of return even if the goods were damaged, they would instead blame the customer and government made slogans such as buyers beware. I still remember in early 90s how one of the big conservative textile shop in my city had a no return policy, they refused to take back damaged good they had sold us, I went to the same shop this year, they had a 15 days return policy what a surprise. 

MNCs changed all this but still people had a sour experience in general with these Indian capitalists add to the fact the MNCs remind them about East India company from our history text books. 

When the Indian businesses change their shitty outlook, Indians would start trusting them. Wtf....you cited Ambani and Adani as having no competition. Are you real?

Let's take the, telecoms sector and new entrant JIO. JIO came in and destroyed all the competition by lowering price that made most telecom companies either merge or go bust. 

A good Telecom regulator would have in some way prevented predatory pricing allowing fair competition to all players in this sector. **Every news be like - Government is God** I think the second point relates to affordability. Do people have choice with the amount of money they have or how many people with that kind of money do we have? The problem is not that we are taught capitalism incorrectly, the problem is that we are not taught capitalism at all. We have been having bad leaders for a really long time now. Political parties have been playing with the emotions of the poor by spreading lies about 'the wealthy'. They also know that it is easier to win an election by giving freebies and loan waivers than actually giving a damn about long term policies. The distrust is because of bad leaders hiding their incompetency behind lies Indian society is a low trust society as it is. I don't know the historical and sociological processes that have turned it this way, but it is what it is. It's made worse at the street level by the neighbourhood shopkeeper who isn't exactly a model of honesty anywhere in India. Even bigger businesses aren't exactly ethical with their customers, are they? Probably, the deep distrust of businesses stems from these two factors. It's not entirely unwarranted. A poor justice system and the role of influence in law enforcement means it's better to start with distrust and be overcautious, rather than trust and lose money.

At a government level, Nehru had the biggest influence in how governments look at businesses. As somebody who had seen the bad effects of colonial capitalist greed on our society, he was instinctively anti-capitalist. That attitude grew worse with Indira when highest levels of taxation on businessmen were imposed in the 70s and 80s. Naturally, they preferred to launder it to tax havens, and I think it is this image of tax-evading businesses that has been imprinted in the modern Indian bureaucrat's and citizen's mind. OMG dude, what have you done! You talked about...capitalism...here!? Oh god, prepare to be bashed and the downvotes.

Well jokes aside, the recent emergence of socialists in America and India are reactionary. Humans are shitheads and when they came to know this, since they can't blame humans, they are taking their anger out on the system - capitalism. Nice scapegoat. You have a problem with your relations? Capitalism. You have problem of diarrhea? Capitalism. The grocer charged you 2 rupees extra? Capitalism. The environment is degrading? Capitalism. As if Adam Smith wrote in his book to do all these.

The right wingers think ""government bad, corporates good"" while leftists think ""government good, corporates bad"". Both are right and wrong in their own way. Rightists understand that markets are important and that centrally planned economy and too much rules and regulations hurt the economy. And leftists are right in the sense that they understand that crony capitalism is harmful and that too many wrong risks can create depression/recession during which the government has to intervene (2008 global crisis). Currently, since right wing is on the rise, there is a reactionary socialist movement, that's all."
Policy/Economy,[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich,229,ch4zwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/,202,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",billionaireinindia," At what level of income does 42% tax come in? So apparently there are only 5000 such people with such high income and so the impact on the country is marginal. This exactly is why this form of taxation is bullshit. There are way more than 5000 people earning 2 crore and above in India.

All the rest not only evade taxes, they also are contributing to the black economy beause they will be penalized otherwise. If India has to mop up tax revenue, we need to stop treating rich people as criminals and make it easier for them to consume more. And tax that consumption. I, for one, am for higher taxation for the super-rich. But where I am in total agreement with you is what the money is being used for. If it was for developing the nation and social welfare schemes I am all for it, but right now it just lines the pockets of politicians and gives out doles to the vote banks. This sucks. I don't want to pay taxes to make someone else rich or to help someone be in power.

&#x200B;

If you want to move abroad, most (developed) countries have a higher rate of taxation than us. But of course, in most of those cases the taxes are put in to better use.

[This wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) compares taxation rates between countries, and you'll see most European countries have a very high tax rate. It can go upto 60% in Scandinavian countries, but then again, in those countries you don't have to pay for education or healthcare. In US, the highest tax rate is 50.5% and in Canada 54% (in Nova Scotia). Even Nepal has a 50% income tax for the super-rich! BTW, I'm curious why you dont buy a US green card though? Under EB5, I think they require 3-4 crore invested and even if invested via brokers and so on I've heard you get most of it back after 5 years... You, my friend, may be an exception. I agree with your points. The quality of life is atrocious - high pollution levels , increasing crime , shabby infrastructure and subsidies for everyone apart from the honest tax payers ( white income ). 

If you have the means look at US or Canada and get an OCI card. I know a lot of people who took EB5 visa to US and escaped the drudgery of life in India. If you belong to a super rich community, you should be Getting TFO of the country. Which is what thousands of French  millionaires did when France passed a ridiculous wealth tax law. 

The smart superrich Indians seem to have got the message too

""Stunningly, India in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7,000 members, or 2 percent, of its millionaire population. ""

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/opinion/sunday/millionaires-fleeing-migration.html

you can't fight an economically illiterate government, which is rewarded by the electorate with crushing margins of victory despite its economically insane policies. (see demonetization).  Expect this pattern (crazy economic policies, military adventures to whip up 'patriotism', religious rabble rousing etc)  to repeat when the next elections come around in 2024.

  If I were you, I'd be long gone to a country where  at the *least* those kinds of high taxes would at least get me something in return.

PS: If you are really super rich (and not trolling us) , and don't plan to leave, maybe you can help some fellow randians GTFO? Thanks in advance ;-) why are you living in india? Cattle class here and i completely agree with you. The budget was a total disappointment. A majority govt is of no use if it cannot take difficult steps. 

India need to grow faster and we need rich hardworking smart people to do that. 

Farmers are glorified, the subsidies are the reason why loss making farms continue to work, there is no consolidation of farm lands even after 70 years, consolidated farmlands are necessary for large scale mechanisation and higher productivity level in agriculture.

Consolidation of farmland will provide necessary cheap labor at factories which will attract foreign capital. Till the time foreign investments arrive govt should utilise this cheap labor for large infrastructure projects.

But fuck it all, loot the rich hardworking class and feed the poor. There is no point saying such reasonable things in India. People here want even moderately successful people to be double and triple taxed on the same income and support giving freebies to farmers, even if it means our public discoms go into debt and can’t distribute electricity efficiently, or urban citizens suffer from a drought because 80% of a reservoir’s water has been diverted to appease rich farmers who lobby the government. 

People even on this thread are calling for even more welfare spending, without even realizing that the cumulative effect of welfare spending every year is the reason we have less to invest in infrastructure than East Asian nations. 

The government will laugh at you, swindle you, demean your education and achievements and harrass you or libel you to gain votes, and then cozy up to you if you’re successful. 70+ years after independence and our financial capital floods every year, illiteracy is still high, the trains are miserable compared to those in Europe, flat, even roads are a rarity and corruption is still sky-high. 

There are encouraging signs, but God this country takes great effort to make sure everyone everywhere is miserable. Our tax is marginal tax. That means entire income isn't taxed at 30% only the value which goes above the slab. A certain % of total income as tax to everyone seems plausible. It true what he said ; “rich"" farmers are not taxed much. I have seen farmers taking advantage of *karj maafi* to buy a nice cars. I used to complain about this when I used to live in India and I used to be in top slab. But the income inequality in India is extreme. If you live in middle class bubble, it's very easy to forget how widespread poverty is in India. 

The wealth gap you see between even a middle class white collar guy and a minimum wage service job guy is insane here. 

There's no way India can provide the same services as developed countries with so much poverty. It's just not going to happen, as we really need the money to develop and maintain our vast rural country. They really need their development a lot more than our services, and that's the harsh reality. Our roads in cities might be crowded and in bad state, but they don't even have enough schools and health facilities. There are no jobs in rural area, farmers are committing suicides. 

As a part of same country, we all contribute to the government in taxes who then has to prioritize who and where it's required. We have obvious issues with random waste and stupid vanity projects, but you cannot treat tax as something which only you should see the entire benefit of. You are subsidising the poor of the country. That's how it's always going to be in every country, but our country has a lot of poverty. 

This is going to get better, but not overnight. it's going to take time. Democracy is mob rule with less violence. Apart from a few oil rich countries, high income tax for rich people is the norm not the exception. So if you think you are a high net worth individual then you're a free to go to any country in the world but be aware you will pay the same percentage or even more in tax.

&#x200B;

The other point that the tax payer's money is being wasted is a valid one. > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%).

LMAO Well making money becomes progressively easier the more money you have. So a progressively higher tax slab isn't wrong.

Whether our tax money is put to good use is a different question. And ofcourse if you have the luxury to move to a different country, you totally should. [deleted]  *Only 6,361 individuals declared incomes of over Rs 5 crore.*   
You are in the 1% of 1% of 1%, aren't you? (Good for you.)

&#x200B;

 *Though the maximum marginal rate of 42.74% tax appears high, it is comparable to the highest tax rates in some other countries. In Germany, the UK, Japan and China, 45% tax rate applies to incomes much below Rs 5 crore annually (taking the current rupee-dollar exchange rate). For example, 45% rate applies to income of Rs 2.04 crore in Germany and Rs 2.53 crore in Japan. In the US, for single tax filers, the top tax rate is 37% for income over Rs 3.42 crore.*

Suggestion: Look into hiring a good accountant. I don't think that even Jeff Bezos paid that much as his personal income tax. Sorry I can't hear the voice of the 1-2 people in India who actually declare income above 5 Cr above the 99% who earn far more than that but show their income as 2.4 LPA. Yes, there is no incentive for super-rich who declare taxes to live in India. Unfortunately it won't make a difference to the economy if the rich people leave, as 90% of the economy is unregulated, cash-based and built on black money. I don't think the government was actually planning on collecting more taxes through this announcement, it will just incentivize the folks who are stuck here and can't leave, to hide their income. This announcement was made just to please the gullible middle class and lower strata into thinking the government is being tough on the ""kaminey"" rich folks. For a suitable bribe, most rich folks can get away with not paying the 42% tax. I live in Germany and pay 39% tax. I'm not super rich anywhere, or even rich for that matter. So apart from how the money is being used, I really don't see what you are complaining about. You can afford it. Stop whining. The poor have it much tougher. Most rich in India don't even pay (direct) taxes but do massive tax evasion and are crooked to the bone. The rich are overrated. >I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Good point . Add to it , rampant tax evasion by corporates + Lalas + corrupt fuckers in general Arvind Subramaniam in Economic Survey had mentioned this problem of “exit”. 

I totally feel you man, you want the “best” of resources for your tax money. And you should leave the country if you do not like the country, or what it offers. 

Meanwhile, let’s remember Will Durant: A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean. The rest of us cannot emigrate, so we have to make do with what the country has to offer. Or work to improve it.

You mention the “Socialist era” period, I’m guessing your a neo rich. Aka New Money.

Cause in Socialist era, the rich had all the possible amenities, no competition due to inspector raj, and cosy relation with the CONgress party and Bureaucrats.

Nothing wrong with being new money, it’s actually great for the economy that anyone can now become “rich”.

I would like remind you, you have a social debt to your society from which you rose. The Indian Education system, Heath care, subsidised fuel, subsidised LPG etc (economic survey subsidies for the rich). If you emigrate, you would essentially make the government subsidies the foreign government.

Also, there have been cases of racism, xenophobia, and outright eviction of foreigners (Zimbabwe).

If you feel taxes are bad, ask the government to reduce it. Vote for it.

Loan waivers are necessary for YOU also, if the rural economy is in distress, it would create a slowdown in demand, and hence production. Aka Bad for you. Yes loan waivers cannot be a permanent solution, but they are a one time benefit for those, unlike you who would use the resources of the State far more than any farmer would.  

The example is just what aboutism. 

Taxes are your social duty, and let us remember Aristotle who says the feelings of inequality is the biggest cause of revolution. Taxes are redistribution, and beneficial to you as well. Get a Canadian PR. I’ve seen a lot of comments here I wanted to clarify some stuff. First, I’m no Ron Swanson. I gladly pay my taxes on time; however, the amount of tax collected and the way taxes are spent are not mutually exclusive. This may not have been clear in my post. If my money was being spent wisely to actually improve all aspects of the country and to uplift people from poverty I would gladly pay more. But this is not the case. Second, people say that I should leave India (for better or worse). The thing is it’s not that easy. The general perception of people leaving this country is that they out thieves and crooks. If I leave I’m pretty sure I’ll be a fugitive in the eyes of the IT department. Curious question, how much do you earn? Less than 100 crores a year or more? > The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies 

This is absolutely hilarious. Rich get tax breaks and benefits of many kind and they have an easier way of avoiding tax than a middle class salaried employee.

I do agree that tax is too high and accountability too low and the system needs to be reformed in a way that incentivizes paying of taxes rather than finding ways to avoid it because that is cheaper alternative. I empathize with you OP. Just give us some lessons on how to become like you. Hamari gand chiri hui hai. We need an AMA. https://imgur.com/a/mFgmH0a


If a person is earning 7.5 crores per year he is taxed on average at 35%. Not that hight at all. he will be getting around 5crores in hand.

This is without claiming any tax relief.

I agree with the OP on one this money should be used properly and agriculture income after 10 lakhs should be taxed.

https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/tools/income-tax-calculator.aspx u/billionaireinindia u made I'd for this rant. Fucking clever bro. Higher taxation on the super rich is a good thing. Sorry Would you be willing to do an AMA on randia? You won't have to pay any tax once the revolution happens. And it is gonna happen very soon! Hold on for a while bro :) It didn;t help that a senior official of Ministry of Finance stated that the UHNI should not complain becuase they would consume private services in India and abroad. But that misses the mark completely. 

&#x200B;

Also, this thread is a great read with a lot of interesting facts and conversations in this thread. Congrats everyone. Give me an idea about how rich we are talking about here. 10cr a year and 100cr a year are both rich but the solution would perhaps be different. 42% tax on the super rich is actually lower compared to most developed countries. 
But I do get the issue with where the tax money goes to. 
Also, wastage and abuse of tax revenues is prevelant everywhere to some extent. Only way to make it better is with your vote and organizing  through local communities and questioning your representatives. My only input in this is not to think from your perspective what you are getting but from the perspective of others what the government is providing for them.

Whether you like it or not, the government meal schemes, the national highways the power plants, government run hospitals, cheap transportation and much more is being provided from that tax money. Taxes are higher at that income level similar to most developed countries so it gives you incentive to keep investing.  

Most people reduce their taxes at that income level by profiting from capital gains on investments.  Generally capital gains have lower tax for most countries. >For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates.

Why don't you ? Not being sarcastic here, genuinely curious. Since you have already discounted patriotic reasons , there is zero reason for you to stay here. As much as I believe tax rates should be high on the super rich, I believe that it is curenelty a very unfair system. With less than a quarter people actually paying taxes, it is ridiculous to except the small group of law abiding tax payers to pay higher amounts of money to appease everybody. The government should first focus on making sure everybody pays taxes. Hire an accountant, don't pay tax. LoL! Leave if that helps your like. Higher taxes for the top bracket is logical & universal. The utilization of the tax rupees is a different matter & that’s a valid question irrespective of what tax one pays! I hope that the increase the tax on the super rich even more. i am a salaried person and in the same dilemma as you are in right now. lets say i earn 11 lacs after all deductions and investment shown so i would be paying 30% or \~3lac from my 11lac which is way high. i cant imagine what guys like you feel after paying exhorbitant taxes on income of 3cr you'd pay >1cr as taxes in return of what? no roads no infra no special advantages of being the employment generator. at the same time i believe that you'd have to pay the same amount of taxes elsewhere too isnt it? r/LateStageCapitalism

And what about India's rising income inequality? I am a common middle class salaried tax paying citizen and I do not mind paying a higher tax, if that money reaches the poor. In other governments, it used to reach the pockets of politicians. But with DBT, I am hopeful that it will help someone buy food, or help save newborns or get a better toilet. 

From a purely capitalist perspective, you may hold the view that the poor should earn their money instead of accepting handouts from government. But why are the rich hoarding all the money? Why can't they put it to good use, like funding infrastructure? Giving to charity does not count. 

Poverty is a disease created by the capitalists. It is sickening. If you can, you should definitely try getting out of this country mate. Hi. It's me. Your new best friend. >Tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.

Benefits? Do super rich in other countries use public transportation, public hospitals and public schools and colleges? Even if they do, is it because the public ones are better than the private ones or is it because they cannot afford private ones? If they can easily afford the private ones then your argument is moot. Not to mention, to make money and be rich you need to fight the system at every level. The govt tries its hardest to stop you from making money. And despite everything if you do make money they'll take half of it from you. Agree with OP 100% . I see no change in quality of healthcare, education, and useful infrastructure ( roads, street lights, bridges, highways, police stations etc ). It was literally same 20 years ago. Why would anyone pay taxes? I am willing to pay 50% of my income but i want to see changes and i want to see it being used for welfare of others.  

My friend in Germany pays similar tax but Germany has free colleges, free healthcare and provides €400 a month aid that can't support itself ( providing food, shelter, rent, water etc. State covers all of it. So the money is being used to educate people can't afford to and after years they will be able to get jobs, and pay for their own stuff reducing the dependence on welfare money. 

I get very few people pay taxes in India but we have it tough. If i earn 50k per month and want to support a family of 4, I can't. I don't want to live in a shitty apartment with a Activa. I'd want better quality life, do you know how ridiculous tuition and college fees are? I'd want to save money for it. I'd want to save money for my kid's wedding and help them complete their education. If state can't provide free Universities and jobs, I'd save my money to support them instead of paying taxes. if anything, it is inadequate. if we have to seriously combat the growing wealth inequality and ecological disasters, we need a high inheritance tax as well. passing on anything more than a few crores (not tens, not hundreds) down the generation should be a crime.

&#x200B;

just out of curiosity, what do you do? and how much do you make? To be honest if you leave India and abandon business here. That would probably mean that newer people will come up to take your place. The reason taxes are so high is not because of infrastructure or development. It's a bribe by rich people to everyone else to not murder them. Our country is always one bad day away from collapse. If the rich want to stop paying the bribe the entire country will collapse. Maybe that might be a good thing. It’s a progressive tax system. The richer u are the more u get taxed and a lot of countries follow this what’s new The groups of people who don't vote on the election day will get less favor from govt. -Democracy \>The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy

&#x200B;

The govt does not want individuals to be wealthy, they want more people to be in the 5-20 lakhs (or so) range. They would prefer 5 engineers being employed by WITCH companies earning 8L each at 5 years of experience than 1 being employed by a FAANG earning 40L out of college. (The first will show up much better in employment data than the second) My 2 cents. It's not enough. The government provides way too many subsidies and the tax should be even higher imo. > Patriotism and bullshit like that.

People like you are reason why east India company, mughals and Afghans could easily rule us. In india you can’t become super rich by hard work and honesty. There definitely would have been some wrong doing you either committed or condoned or looked the other way. If it was ancestral it’s mostly the money or natural wealth squeezed out of poor people probably belonging to lower caste or tribals. [deleted] Please do tell me what hard work did you put in to ""earn"" that money Just wanted to ask you few things

1. Is 42.7% your effective tax rate or just marginal tax rate of the top bracket?

2. What's your reaction to the taxes on all types of investment (mainly stock market) profits?
I recently read that US doesn't tax long term capital gain of even foreign nationals. Will that make you reconsider investing in Indian market? I mean if I was that rich I would be sad too but what can you do, it's not like you guys are in a position to bring about a change right? With almost all of the citizens for such a reform. The only option is to Emigrate or pay up There's a great passage at the end of The White Tiger where the narrator talks about the cost of having to pay off the police chief to cover up a traffic accident. It's a lot of money. But paying that money is a rich person's problem. Dealing with the accident is a poor person's problem.

At the end of the day, you have the money to be taxed. You are not starving. To suggest that taxation removes the incentive to be rich is ridiculous. [deleted] If you own a business which serves Indian customers, for example a restaurant or clothing brand or any fmcg brand, the tax is justified because your wealth is earned because of the rest of the population. In India, businessmen have advantage of a lot of customers which increases their profit. Now if such a businessman takes their business to another country, it won't work because nowhere else you will find as many customers, plus differences in market needs.

Yes you can move your company to low tax countries like Singapore like some ecommerce companies have done, but that's a loophole govt needs to close.

Compared to a businessman, a working professional can move anywhere because their skill is in demand everywhere, be it white or blue collar job.

Now about tax utilization, that I agree with. If the government will spend tax to fund new businesses, or help scaling existing businesses, that would help more in increasing jobs and tax base. A rich brat ranting in a piss poor country, what a drama queen No man, don't lie"
Policy/Economy,When Vodafone dialled a wrong number in India,28,d1nl58,https://www.rediff.com/business/special/when-vodafone-dialled-a-wrong-number-in-india/20190909.htm,3,,ppatra," As someone living in Mumbai, I can tell you Vodafone users would not switch to Jio for at least a year! It was below their dignity to take something that is so cheap. However, Vodafone would not capitalize on this amazing brand value. Instead, they leeched on to these users without upgrading their network. Eventually, everyone bought a second sim from Jio and slowly it became their primary sim. Later, a few fully jumped to Jio.

Jio was literally too good and Vodafone was too slow. Look at how Airtel fights Jio and keeps upgrading. Vodafone tried to squeeze far too much and instead had nothing to hold on to! Great gift from Pranab Mukherjee. While he gets a Bharat Ratna, his actions will probably result in the exit of one of the highest investors in India. Reliance entering a mature market and going all guns blazing pocketing govt and policy makers to get a foothold in the telecom market is an indication of future potential.   All the praises being sung about by the analysts is sounding alarm bells.   These narratives are being spun to sell these businesses off to public successfully.   With slowdown hitting the economy locally and globally, Reliance is going to suffer disproportionately due to its legs in highly sensitive retail sector.   Other way to look at it is also wasting of capital or capacity in the industry(telecom).   No. Of companies gone bankrupt and capital extinguished due recklessness of Reliance is costing the country in terms of jobs and tax revenues. The govt. favoured Reliance by policies and rule changes without which Reliance would not made any headway either in telecom or oil & gas.   Consumers have benefited is a silver lining, but costs is paid by other sections of economy in terms of job losses, NPAS and consequently lack of capital to necessary sectors that require investment.   Reliance could have been more socially responsible by subsidised fuel from its refinery that would have had multiplier effect on the economy by reducing the costs of transportation.   Reducing telecom rates have helped bollywood and made people distracted from self development and watch medias/videos during their work hours.   Today all the additional data is used majorly to watch entertainment videos and in turn this brings down productivity and aggregate of that to a certain degree contributes to economic incompetence and slowdown."
Policy/Economy,RBI's deputy governor Viral Acharya quits six months before his term ends,101,c4hsqq,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbis-deputy-governor-viral-acharya-quits-six-months-before-his-term-ends/articleshow/69920503.cms,37,,killswitch13," >Acharya has been uncomfortable ever since the exit of Urjit Patel as Governor of RBI. His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.


Damocles Sword

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow. 



Global Currency 


INR will get devalued significantly to attract investment and will further push outward mobilisation.",lightnh," [deleted] Things certainly look shitty but it may be too early to call it a doomsday kind of scenario.  Govt fucked up and have realized their mistakes.  They are too egoistic to admit their mistakes but have reverted back some of their shitty moves.  The corporate tax cut is not going to fix demand issues directly or right away but can help attract some of the investments moving out of China. That can be a huge plus in the years to come.

Bullet train looks like a white elephant currently but if you think, wouldnt be great to have world class trains here like other developed countries?  And not just for ornamental reasons or for the politics of it.  Imagine the growth of business if Bangalore - Chennai or other similar places, the travel can be done within 2 hours?  Infrastructure investments otherwise is a good thing - the roadways, tunnels and waterways will help future generations.  If anything we need to have even more infra development projects.  Dont we love the infra of foreign countries?  These projects dont happen over night and need hige amount of planning and vision. Infra projects also provide employment to thousands of people, which helps with GDP and helping with demand side issues.

Migration has always been a thing. There is nothing new about it. All the people participating in ""Howdy Modi!"" are people who migrated out of the country looking for better prospects. Isnt it?  It may be another topic all together that they assume it to be their moral and birth right to comment on what is good or bad for India. We are country of 1.3 billion people.  Few crores people migrating will not necessarily hurt us. if at all it can help bring in remittance.  Yes, brain drain is a thing. It has been around for generations and I don't see it reducing anytime soon.  Perhaps spreading of rightwingers Govt everywhere in the world may mitigate it a bit due to racism etc.

Yes, there are draconian policies and misadventures like Demon, shitty GST implementation, ugly and useless statues etc.. But good economics does not necessarily mean good politics.  And to win elections, one needs good politics and optics.  The wrath of the market forced Govt to rollback some of their shitty policies.  The euphoria behind corp tax cut may not last forever, and pure economics may start playing.  And as i started off, it may be too early to call it a May Day! Good points. Work on your exit plan.

Perhaps you know what the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is. If you don’t, let me explain.
 
(No, don’t be alarmed. It has nothing to do with that other Five Point thing. Calm down. Breathe)
 
There’s this thing in martial arts called the Touch of Death. In essence, it’s a technique that’s supposedly used to kill someone using quick, otherwise non-lethal force targeted at specific areas of the body. Shrouded in secrecy and replete with legend, the Touch of Death attacks pressure points in the body “to incapacitate or cause immediate or even delayed death to an opponent”.
 
Nobody even knows if it’s effective but let’s assume it is. Like air purifiers in Delhi.  
 
The Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is a type of Touch of Death made famous in the movie ‘Kill Bill’. In it, a person is hit on five different pressure points on the body. After the person moves and takes five steps, their heart explodes and they die. Gruesome.
 
I don’t think anybody is going to die, but last week, the Indian economy was hit on five different, crucial pressure points.
 

[Five blows fell in five days. India's business newspapers could scarcely keep up.](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BJk787lZDaABuyrHTQLzaoYlOwrndvdUlObe_UtMI3YVXmPSON9fOWgEcrbr6MNN6VWQ7M_jPzLsf8SWfq-xmkG0TA2DGGJIA_4cCn3Rytt_HSa3aIs5VqXVaRWQlUjzZfCgUqh7m7m7wijNDI3PSfylixMppT63nlnNoLDlon-JlZcFB5bELPcPri3TFaNbOfhP5K9QTlanAI8S45qh3bt78GWszx548kk1UXVbgC4b9wXqBNL096ZxWwbIark5pZHTFlzKvoaWQQvpzLZhT6m-CWY=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/bfde2eb287584a0f6c4724b91aa718235df52e77f4bb80dd161f6b8a67fdcd0be997d68cac3982e9c2d07902d0ebc98054b085b7ad7d30ffce6490ccfcd629fb.jpg)

**On Monday, the tax collection numbers trickled in**
 
The Income Tax department has a problem. It’s not getting enough taxes.
 
And it’s across multiple tax categories.
 
Corporate tax grew by just 0.5% between April to October as compared to the previous year. The plan, according to the budget, was for Corporate Taxes to go up by 15.4% as compared to the previous year. Of course, a big chunk of the shortfall is attributable to the corporate tax cuts that occurred a couple of months back.
 
Personal income collection grew by 5% over the same period, against the year’s target of 22.4%.
 
Direct tax collection touched Rs 5,20,000 crore (~ $78 Bn), which is just 39% of the year’s target. To meet the goal, the income tax department will need to expand its collection rate by 30%.
 
This leaves the I-T department with two options. Either get more aggressive with tax collections. Or ask for targets to be cut.
 
Right now, the I-T department is getting...mixed messages.

As Reuters reported,
 
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants them to collect 17% more in direct taxes this year as New Delhi seeks to shore up revenues amid a sharp economic slowdown. The target has been maintained even though Modi recently approved a massive cut in corporate taxes, which are part of direct taxes, and warned officers not to harass businesses in their drive to collect revenue.
 
Over a dozen tax officials interviewed by Reuters said they are stuck between a push to meet unrealistic collection targets, which influence their appraisals and transfers, and the fear of being accused of over-zealousness if they crack down on evasion.”
 
So what’s the I-T department doing, now that it’s stuck between a rock and a hard place?
 
On one hand, it’s getting creative with its definitions of what’s taxable. This week, they conducted preliminary enquiries to find out if they could levy a 18% GST (Goods and Services Tax) on CXO salaries.
 
I am not even going to try to explain the I-T department’s reasoning, but suffice to say, taxing income as a service is...a stretch, you’d think.
 
And lawyers agree. As the Economic Times reported,
 
“The interpretation adopted by the tax authorities is that an employee of an organisation should be considered as an employee of a particular office only (not the organisation as a whole) for GST-related purposes. Such an interpretation is legally and factually incorrect,” said Rohit Jain, partner with law firm ELP.
 
On the other hand, the I-T department is desperately trying to bring down their targets. And not by a small amount.
 
As the Business Standard reported,
 
“We are expecting a cut of at least Rs 1 trillion in the Budget target for direct tax collection to bring it closer to the ground realities. Economic slowdown has severely affected our mop-up, and corporation tax cuts have made the target further unrealistic,” said a government official.
 
So, a little bit of both.

**On Tuesday, the industrial output numbers were released**
 
How does one measure the health of industries?
 
The way India does it is through something called the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Just like a stock market index, the IIP is represented by categories like manufacturing, consumer durables, capital goods, and so on.
 
In good times, the index trends upwards. Occasionally, one or more categories may be down, either due to seasonality or due to cyclical demand, but overall, it’s usually growing.
 
In July this year, for instance, the index was up by 4.6%.
 
In August, it was down by 1.4%. This was an 81-month low. The thinking at the time was that this was probably an anomaly, and things would be back on track the next month once the September numbers were released, especially because of the festival season in October.
 
It was released on Tuesday.
 
In September, the index was down by 4.3%.
 
All thanks to one sector—manufacturing, which accounts for 78% of the index.
 
Why is this worrying? Because it’s clear that nobody believes this is an anomaly. Least of all, manufacturers, who didn’t even bother to boost production output before the festive season in October.
 
“September, the month before the festive season kicked in, saw production of consumer durables contract for the fourth-straight month. Production contracted by 10 per cent, up from 9 per cent in the previous month. The negative growth baffled economists who said e-commerce sales in October was very high and should have been on the back of positive growth in this segment.
 
Crucially, the consumer non-durables category slipped into contraction for the first time in FY20, with production thinning by 0.4 per cent. ""The sequential worsening in the performance of consumer durables and non-durables in September belies any hopes of a pre-festive restocking of inventories,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said.
 
To explain what happened on Wednesday, here’s Rohin.

**On Wednesday, an entire sector raised a flag of surrender**
 
Hope is a wonderful thing. It keeps you going in the face of adversity. It is so powerful that it can reshape the reality around you, so you see hope where others only see despair.[ Like Vodafone-Idea in India all these years, even in the face of quarterly results that looked like this.](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wRUWxgIhI3RAddBCCk4YzwZKw8Nk3RUSfg3dwL6DTzHkewpBfw51BrTRoQBBD_e6_p8prrSTEEpVLmnV1N56vFl4rY5Adu39Wt0ydJNTqu84l8sScPCmjRAGKfDzedF0xWUzW8w7gJP0O8H1cWkaHBYP8aGrMGPhjKnUBLexkDdjG0i1yCZXvtw1HCYlCcmiilNho7jSLCG1B-9L9aS0_OYc_92k_iiaipAkJP-I6JQYejc1QssaX-RVT1pO6Z9GwhZn3pgUrY_4UBmx9jXyKRmjRzA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c57f772ed4710fe5ad2873497cbe3b2aa68f1b8bfd08d75a992950304074479bc1759b013be1b8e1a9c11e058517342f0c35c1a1db222f2a1e4c7d0b07523c16.png)

But everyone reaches a breaking point. Reservoirs of hope aren’t endless either. On Wednesday, Vodafone must have realised that after posting the largest quarterly loss in India’s history. A loss so gargantuan that the axis numbers in the above graph, with added data from the latest quarter, [were no longer recognizable.](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XF7y_RPS_ljUaqF8FSIv_8hQ2D7GtA1TDqphEpOiZr0kRz-EohSG52OD55PJNCsPu5hNQG7-sCN1ArF2b4cuS9p4f5zTvE42Pz7InNkU3UJYGGBZSWWMAwxWnEuFqLZIcua4LXTqYtKw6IKmfPQ9fVYDaap_YZgWx-x0rmzliS0uuubBD_fRGJed7B_9ICA4vQ6f-JOt4K6QL29lMRumBVc1BoFRX3An6fvQzkYwc-zJIz1pV0fH2cL1gVLtabY0cAcxHUi94T98fqsg2eGWe5WRm5M=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c8c2d733c0c4ec3c5ea7bbfff69fc527a8d29779e7a2c48de26a6685493ad54c29c19dc6cd8d31770d565802dea5b2259753791c30d9acd376a8c4c429c37c45.png)

And that was how Vodafone, which owns 44.3% of Vodafone-Idea (27.6% is owned by Indian business conglomerate Aditya Birla Group), lost hope.
 
Vodafone-Idea’s loss was triggered by the imposition of a massive $4 billion retrospective fine demanded by the Indian government and ratified by its Supreme Court last month. (We wrote about it in depth in an earlier issue of The Nutgraf). A fine that came atop existing debt of $14 billion.

At a press meeting in London, Vodafone CEO Nick Read threw up his hands.
 
“Financially there’s been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and on top of that we got the negative supreme court decision.
 
If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical. If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario -- can’t get any clearer than that.”
 
A “going concern” is an accounting concept that assumes a private company has the financial resources to continue operations for at least the near future, usually at least 12 months. A company that does not believe it is a going concern is usually headed for operational disruptions, fire sales of assets and finally, a bankruptcy.
 
Thus, CEOs do not kid around with the phrase. Certainly not CEOs of global corporations like Vodafone.
 
In India, the mood in Vodafone-Idea’s finance department must have been funereal when they added the following lines to the latest quarterly results.
 
“It is to be noted that our ability to continue as going concern is dependent on obtaining the reliefs from the Government as discussed above and positive outcome of the proposed legal remedy. Pending the outcome of the above matters, these financial results have been prepared on a Going Concern Basis.”
 
This is company speak for: we’re drowning, and if the government doesn’t throw us a life preserver, we’ll be sleeping with the fishes.
But it wasn’t just Vodafone-Idea that was revisiting the concept of “going concern.” Bharti Airtel, India’s second largest private telecom operator, told stock exchanges it, too, had doubts about its future.
 
“This represents a material uncertainty whereby, it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, and accordingly may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.”
[
That’s after Airtel’s quarterly earnings graph became this.](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/IZQwUkAVdxQZbPTcYwouDQrfEZndZQS6xJ-fo2kYYWfd2mVijNyMatuUiSpTRofLx1B0z_V0ID2OPzOFsfaLdIFQ0_GNjEIQw5izl081CHb334vgH1T--141J2xwPwHVdLA8miyezCuRZkAq8gM3or0UedJaaz74UajtylyBupI1X4BOBfUOSIWCKQ8zVcM3On5AauGUM7aS0z6fCh1x5azJMHBfXBz0N2_nvqa4M2USmvUrTEikiyGYz5V7WdyoXflyBICA5gSZFOl7BnNmuVk-3aI=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/a64851dea9f82b76766d206656f405e40e3b4e486fa662f0415d6cf11b007830fd8506c75c95ec5b7704130e3a90b0c06d9bc780f6497dd79cd8e720119b2eae.png)


With 2 out of the 3 private telecom operators in the doldrums, India risked turning back two decades of progress in telecom, argued Sunil Jain in the Financial Express.
 
“The other reason why Modi needs to listen to Read is that, once Vodafone Idea shuts down, India will be back to where it was in 1999 before the Vajpayee government ushered in India’s telecom revolution.
 
Prior to 1999, there were just two mobile services providers; while Vajpayee ensured unlimited competition was brought in, India could once again have just two players, RJio and Bharti Airtel (apart from BSNL-MTNL, provided the merger and VRS results in a viable firm). In which case, the government/Trai will be back to monitoring the industry closely to guard against cartelization, rigging prices and stifling innovation; each tariff plan will have to, once again, be cleared by Trai. Most governments and regulators attempt to increase competition to ensure the industry grows well, the Modi government will preside over the death of two decades of competition.”
 
How did the Department of Telecom, the government department charged with “formulating developmental policies for the accelerated growth of the telecommunication services” react to this distress?
 
First it said, Oh, we’re still working out the numbers, but Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel better steel themselves for another 10% increase in their retrospective fines.
 
Then it requested the Supreme Court to prevent a merger between Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices (now defunct), because it wanted another Rs 8,000 crore (~$1.2 billion) from Bharti Airtel. The merger it was objecting to took place in October 2017.
 
Things ended on a good note though finally, with Vodafone CEO writing to the Indian government to proclaim that he is confident of the India growth story and that the country remains a key market for his company.
 
Vodafone meanwhile wrote down the value of its 44.3% shareholding in Vodafone-Idea to zero.
 
Then came Thursday.

**On Thursday, the inflation numbers came in**
 
If there was one thing that was working in the Indian economy’s favour, it was this—inflation was on the lower side. In fact, it had been declining slowly and steadily for years.
 
That ended on Thursday.
 
As the Economic Times reported,
 
India's Retail inflation for the month of October breached the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018 due to higher food prices even though RBI had predicted that food prices ""are likely to moderate as winter supplies enter the market"".
Inflation is said to be a tax on the poor. Which in itself is bad enough. But there’s a bigger problem.
 
The good thing about keeping inflation in check is that it gives the RBI a very useful weapon to combat a slowdown—rate-cuts.
 
With inflation going up, that weapon gets blunter. And difficult to use. As the article quoted above goes on to say,
 
The Uptick in headline inflation and its subsequent breach of the Central bank's medium-term target might push RBI to put the breaks on its rate cut cycle in the next MPC meet that is scheduled for December 5.
 
To summarise the week so far:
 
Prices are going up

Industrial output is falling

Tax collections are down

The telecom sector is on the verge of collapse
 
Then came Friday.
 
When things went from bad to...bizarre.

 **On Friday, the consumer expenditure survey results came out...and went away**
 
So there’s this organisation in India called the National Statistical Office (NSO). This is a government organisation that’s a part of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
 
The most important thing the NSO does is to go out and collect data. Periodically. Data about income. About consumption. About many other things. All of this data is used by the government of India to draft policy, design welfare schemes, target benefits, etc.
 
Cool? Cool.
 
So there’s one important activity that the NSO does called the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Every five years, it checks what people are consuming and where they are spending their money on. The last time this survey was done was in 2011-12. So the next survey results were expected to be released anytime.
 
It dropped on Friday.
 
Not from the government.
 
But was leaked by a journalist at Business Standard, Somesh Jha.
 
What did it say?
 
Read it for yourself.
 
Consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening rural demand, according to the latest consumption expenditure survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO).
 
Experts said a dip in consumption expenditure indicated an increasing prevalence of poverty in the country. The data set also corroborates a shortage of demand in the economy, driven by the rural market.
 
The lowest in four decades.
 
What happened next?
 
A statement.
 
“In view of data quality issues, the Ministry (of Statistics and Programme Implementation) has decided not to release the consumer expenditure survey results of 2017-2018. The ministry is separately examining the feasibility of conducting the next consumer expenditure survey in 2020-2021 and 2021-22 after incorporating all data quality refinements in the survey process”
 
This means that India will not have an estimate on poverty levels for nearly a decade.
 
Is there anything to be optimistic about?
 
Well, I am not an economist, but perhaps the last week was where India hit the bottom. Maybe the worst is behind us. Maybe the actions taken earlier will start to kick in.
 
It’s just one of those weeks where everything that could go wrong, did.
 
Next up is Sreedhar, about a city called Amaravati.

***Investments are subject to politics***

Here’s an interesting story.
 
Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, was to be an exemplar for city development. The state government acquired a large swathe of land to build a city from scratch. The state’s past track record, it has topped the Ease of Doing Business index for Indian states for years now, meant investors were brought on board, funding secured and a roadmap etched.
 
But then the Andhra Pradesh government changed. And with it so did Amaravati’s fortunes. The city was deeply associated with the flamboyance of its former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu. So, his successor, Jagan Mohan Reddy, chose to quickly and steadily kill projects associated with Naidu.
 
This week, he cancelled a contract with a Singapore consortium which was to build an exclusive startup area in the new city. He also trashed contracts with companies for a new airport, two seaports and a mall in the state.
 
Earlier, the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank withdrew separate loans totalling $500 million dollars.
 
A political powerplay affecting investments into what was to be a grand project could have a ripple effect across the state and country. The fickleness of India’s state governments means that investors will have one eye on a party’s political platform before pulling out the cheque book again.
 
And over to Jon, for our evergreen segment...

***Last Week in Softbank***

What do OYO, Paytm, WeWork, Didi Chuxing and Grab have in common?
 
None are profitable—that’s right—but there’s more. These are SoftBank Vision Fund unicorns that have all made unlikely forays into the Japanese market.
 
It’s no accident. SoftBank has a penchant for bringing portfolio companies to Japan, its home country and a place that its chairman Masayoshi Son has lambasted for an “underdeveloped” tech ecosystem.
 
“As I love Japan, I want to invest in Japanese companies but the reality is that there are no unicorn AI companies in the country,” he said at a conference in July. Unsurprisingly, a glut of Son’s Great Hopes have arrived—each entering through joint ventures with SoftBank, a move that gives the investor a greater say in operations.
 
OYO opened an initial 100 hotels in October; Japan is Paytm’s first move overseas—it claims 10 million users over 10 months; China’s Didi teamed up with SoftBank to take on Uber, a rival counts both among its investor bench. There’s evidence the JV strategy contains a dose of magic. WeWork—the struggling co-working giant that saw its valuation fall from $40B to $10B following a canceled IPO—is said to be close to profitability in Japan. Yes, you read that right.
 
Now it’s the turn of Grab. But rather than a JV, the Southeast Asian ride-hailer has arrived in Japan courtesy of Splyt, an innovative startup that connects ride-hailing services to enable users to ‘roam’ between countries. We’ve written about Grab's struggle to become profitable, and it’ll no doubt hope that the sprinkling of Japanese pixie dust is both genuine and contagious.
That’s it from me.

na·tion·al·ist
noun
a person who strongly identifies with their own nation and vigorously supports its interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. Media, be it Indian or western, did not give the tag of Hindu Nationalist to Modi. Modi gave the tag ""Hindu Nationalist"" to himself and he did it well before Trump ran for the US presidential election. So, it is you who is presumptuous and ignorant, not the western media. To confirm it, here is the link to Modi's interview.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp2WVorCM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSp2WVorCM4) Well India's economical view is very different from China and USA. 

Easiest way to put it is, China and USA are competing to be the leaders, India is just competing to be the Secretary.

China and USA are competitors Chinese electronic  companies are slowly increasing their standards to meet the standards of US companies. Where as India just cares about Employment which you can get from few outsourced works. 

The true globalist award should go to P. V. Narasimha Rao for opening up the economy.
Modi is just doing exactly what Manmohan Singh and Vajpayee did with extra advertisement and show. I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live

- Rabindra Nath Tagore. I wish there was some Indian Alex Jones equivalent accusing Modi of being a globalist . All we have is liberals/secularists accusing Modi of drinking Muslim children's blood every night (which may be true)  . He is a ""Hindu Globe Totterist"". Are you happy now? ""allowed top indian tech companies like flipkart be bought out, and allowed Amazon in etc etc.. ""

Looks like the one I had posted got downvote brigaded, shame because it was from associated press. Govt. has to focus on the economy. People elected the current government in the hopes of stronger economy and much, much needed job creation. They seriously need to get their act together and focus on things that matter. Economy, environment and getting rid of corruption needs to be priority. [removed] Love these news stories. this Kashmir thing is deviating us from the economy This is a joke

Sports,"‘I’m human before anything else’: Athlete Dutee Chand opens up on love, life and sport. Indian sprinter Dutee Chand says she hopes to win many more medals for the country and set up an academy for athletes in Odisha in the future.",867,drc3kb,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/i-m-human-anything-else-athlete-dutee-chand-opens-love-life-and-sport-111665,31,,darkpaste," Dutee chand should not be a cautionary tale. This should inspire more people in the sports to come out. Go girl!  *Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.*  \- Captain Holt She is an inspiration to many, go girl and make your country and parents proud. Didn't the British made being gay illegal in India? I forgot where I read it but before the British came and fucked us over it was ok here? Can anyone confirm? She is an inspiration. And I say this as a straight female. So real and genuine. More on her and the struggles she faced. 

 [https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dutee](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/dutee) Firstly ... Congratulations to proud of India Dutee Chand

Secondly ... I would like to salute your thoughts and future plans Why Indian people do not see the profession & personal life separately?

Indian MODIA always combines these two things for the personal benefit of TRP. Why can't have qualified sports ministers like her? So her sister is a cop and was blackmailing her, interesting little nugget about cops and Indian families. This is a significant change in India. Sports persons from economically weaker sections of society are coming out. They have the hunger to win. That is what separates them from those who are born with a comfortable lifestyle. I believe there are some changes our government has done that has resulted in bringing medals in different sports. Yaas You know who else said he was human before anything else ??

Sports,Pleasantly surprised with the amount of sports Hotstar is making available.,139,dvrc4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dvrc4w/pleasantly_surprised_with_the_amount_of_sports/,37,"Hotstar is currently streaming U17 Women's Football Tigresses vs Panthers match. Why it's surprising that this match is being streamed:

* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

I don't follow other sports much, but a few badminton opens were also streamed AFAIK.",SreesanthTakesIt," Hotstar VIP is such a value of money. They always mess up the telecast via dish tv like how showing cricket in all star sports channels. Hotstar even telecasts esports. That's how deep they go. The quality is shit sometimes, but I can live with it. 

Now, if they could get AEW on their channel, literally everything I watch will be on Hotstar. I watched all of CWC and IPL on HotStar. My subscription money has been earned back easily Don’t forget the f1. Though the coverage is not comprehensive, like they don’t telecast fp1-2-3. But still a place to watch the qualifiers and race. The only issue I have with Hotstar is that their sports streaming quality is so bad! Low bitrate and an awful player ; I tend to find other streams even though I subscribe to Hotstar. Yes it's really good with the different kind of sports it's making available. Badminton coverage has been excellent.

Wonder how much the media rights for a U-17 women's football were acquired for (maybe free, it has only 4 teams). It's being organized by FSDL which is a Reliance subsidiary. For a newly launched event getting listed on streaming sites like hotstar and jio would be a boon. They stream F1. <3 Does it work with Chromecast? To the football fans, Hotstar is definitely a treat, up along with Jio TV which also shows some not so top level matches .

And even *Full Replays*…!! 

Its so amazing.

If I miss a match somehow due to timing etc, I can just see  the Replay 

Plus all the HBO shows!

It's definitely better than Prime or slightly better at the same price range

The only downside being its data consumption being too high, higher than Netflix and Prime Video. Where can I watch wrc races? I took the vip subscription just to watch ISL. Its definitely worth the money and also you can watch multiple sporting events. Hoping that the upcoming Olympics will also be streamed. Who here watches Women's football and what makes it interesting? I tried watching the world cup game; was boring so I'm interested in knowing if it's worth watching again. If yes, please suggest matches/teams/leagues. Now its even streaming endgame in hindi , and is all set to get most of the disney plus content , along with most having localisation in indian languages , netflix will have to DRIVE ahead fast , tailgating PrimeVideo to actually compete with them in india. Yeah hotstar has been a great boon for the neglected sports in India. 

Plus the fact that they have shows like Chernobyl make the deal even more worth it. I wish they stream chess. How to watch hotstar from outside India anyone know Is there boxing and mma? I feel hotstar vip / premium at 1000 Rs for a month is very much value for Money."
Sports,Was told to not play sports as no one would marry me if my complexion turned dark: Sania Mirza.- One of India’s most successful tennis players reflects on the challenges she faced as a child.,298,deh7di,https://scroll.in/field/939333/was-told-to-not-play-sports-as-no-one-would-marry-me-if-my-complexion-turned-dark-sania-mirza,59,,pammoth," Marriage... The society can't see anything other than that Clearly that warning turned out to be false. India's heartthrob ♥️ also the reason why Indian men started taking special interest in tennis. This is one of examples of colonial hangovers. 
I still see examples of aunties saying, ""arre uska rang kitna saaf hai"". The moment you say that, you are unconscious implying that being dark is being dirty. Pathetic. I was never allowed to play outside after 1st grade for the same reason. I've ha a sad childhood. Kudos to her. Bro pakistan jaake shadi karni padi tujhe /s I don't like her. She is pretentious. Obviously Yes She is  **successful tennis players** and she always try to win for India. Today is birth date and I wish you [happy birthday  to Sania Mirza](https://www.sunsigns.org/famousbirthdays/profile/sania-mirza/) Colour is the not the first thing you notice when you see Sania mirza... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) says the girl who married cricketer from where again? :) aha the 75k make up kit wali... That's not exclusive to you Santa Ji. Tanning is not a problem but hyperpigmentation is and sun exposure leads to hyperpigmentation in some individuals like pigmentation around the eyes, freckles, mouth etc . Also sun is very harmful for our skin .So I would recommend do not go out in the sun especially girls because female skin is more prone to hyperpigmentation and sun damage . And it is very difficult to treat hyperpigmentation of indian and black skin tones. If your parents advised you to not go in the sun at an early age for whatever reason indirectly they did a favour to you . But if you still want uneven skin tone then that's your choice. And do you guys think sania mirza never went to a dermatologist for skin treatments ? I can tell by looking at quality of her skin that she did had treatments. And all of these treatments make your skin fairer then it was before treatment , although not fair then your natural complexion."

Our life is a Game. Swimming daily for 1 hr Badminton...2v2...love it I play Badminton. I use Playo app to find partners to play with. Typically, people who play the same sports block a court in a nearby facility and host it on Playo. FYI, there are other games being hosted on Playo too. No Gym. Mostly running 100km overall in a week. No fat. Small abs. No health issues.

Intra city club games I go for a run 5 days a week and other 2 days do some other exercises Tennis , Squash and low insensitivity running. Swimming and cycling even though I guess they aren't considered playing I used to be a district level boxer. Football. I play centre half or DM. Love just pushing players around using my strength. Miss those days. I just play it on bed. It's enough for me I guess. Hasthmaithun is the only sport i play Basketball. Squash, negotiating potholes on roads. Pocket pool. Yea CS and TF2 Football . Once a week for an hour or two. Kirkit What the fuck is randians eSports > go for a run?

Do something connected to another religion and suddenly the same guys go ""Don't weaken our religion"". A lot of our indian muslim brethren shy away from associating with Hindu festivals than the reverse.
Many Hindus too hate Eid and other islamic festivals with equal fervour.
But overall I have seen more excitement amongst those Hindus who look forward to EiD than in those muslims who look forwars to diwali.
I guess for many ppl, irrespective of religion it all comes down to what your festival signifies.
Either it is for making a statement to the ""other"" side about your glory and grandeur
Or its about organising an event for get together with neighbouring community. He is already a Hindu. Just doesn't reveal it because he doesn't want to lose a chunk of his orthodox fans."
Sports,We are not perfect,580,e7s7rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7s7rg/we_are_not_perfect/,377,"19(m) just an average boy in college with a messed up life..so the other day i overheard my parent's conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how i have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age(having no financial support)have done wonders. And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!",spacejesus01," I’m 24 and unemployed I’m 30 and my self esteem is still tied to approval from others. 20s, and I have zero ambition and drive. I'm 8 years old, I didn't get into IIT I am 23, and scared to drive My dad stopped comparing me with others after  I was raged asf and started comparing him, his salary, our assets etc with my friends fathers and his friends.

Since that day, I’ve never felt soo good. Unconditional love is a scam. Your parents,girlfriend also have certain conditions when they will love you. You have to have certain job, looks ,satisfy their expectations when they will ""love"" you. I found that recently I'm 28. By our society's standards, I'd be considered an achiever. And I fucking fought really hard for it after an extremely abusive and poor childhood. But, I have anxiety issues. People don't understand it though. 25 and anxious to drive a car after a bad accident. 😁 I have ambition but no dedication, I am extremely lazy. ""I am 49 and your dad is dumb."" I'm 31 and no idea what to do and scared about the future all the time. I am 31, have very very big aims in life. But not even moving a finger to achieve it.. I'm 26 and still in college. 19 hates driving,but is pressurized into doing it. I'm 25, my man! Haven't driven anything ever. Here's more:

* No friends nearby. I have friends but not one single friend whom I can call up anytime.
* I have no job, I am working on my software product. So living with parents for past 1 year.
* No money. (read above point.)
* Father probably hates and sees me as a failure.
* He also thinks I'm not man enough because of next two points...
* Short for a guy. (5'4 ish)
* Skinny af.
* Never kissed or even had anything resembling a girlfriend.
* Did I miss anything? There's too much pressure to be special, i mean somewhere here only you'll find someone saying ""no but you're different, you're not like everyone else"" is it that bad to be an average person ? I think it's okay to be okay. Well to all the boys... the only thing I can say having lived in a PG in Mumbai, sharing the room with 5 strangers, and surviving on a diet ofvada-pav is this

> it’s okay to be dejected,

> It’s  okay to feel like a complete failure,

> It’s okay to not find love,

> It’s okay to have disappointed parents,

> It’s okay not to have money,

> It’s okay to do a stupid job,

> It’s okay that no one gets you,

> It’s okay.

> It’s okay.


> But,

> never stop learning,

> never give up,

> never ever.



> And

> Be strong,

> Be humble,

> Be kind. Fuck society that tries to measure you, especially that of your parents. You’re you no one can compare you , but they will do that at every step.. They think it’s their job and they will be persistent and passionate about it , so you better develop some serious belief in defying them and believing in yourself instead of sucking up to their judgment.

Tell yourself this : Growing up in this sick society means developing a thick enough skin where you don’t care a shit about such opinions, and I hope you grow into a person that’s defined by you and you take pride in what you’re striving for.

Your personality, your yardstick... everything else can go get fuck itself. Its this attitude of parents that leads to teen suicides. I am sorry not trying to be rude about your parents.. but stating the facts. 23 completed my undergrad and pursuing CA and CS. Cleared intermediate exams for both with good score but I’m not even interested in the commerce field. 

Absolutely no idea what to do with my life and currently, just going with the flow. Can we get F's in chat? Tell him it's his genetics , all the overachievers usually have intelligent parents .... This will really piss him off I'm 24. I can't drive. I haven't even bothered to learn to cycle. You have all your life. Screw that shit. 19 is not even that old. You've technically not even started adult life. Most parents think that millennials are dumb and are taking our nation to shit due to their smartphone and pubg addiction. But in reality it's the politicians voted by everyone including older generation. I'm 28. Bought my first car this year. Can't drive. Hate all sports. The idea of going to the gym makes me wanna cry. I've just popped in from the exchange with /r/Ireland, I hope that's ok! I felt the same at 19, dropped out of college and all that jazz. I got lucky with a job, got qualified picked up some hobbies and now I'm putting myself back through college. Take it as it comes, if you're not progressing in one aspect of life pick something else to move on in. I can't professionally move up for another year or so, so I've entered into relevant courses, started diving and learning new things.

As time goes on you'll see the similarities in how you feel and how everyone else acts, everyone is doing the same thing. Just be trying. I’m 30 and broke Same here.

""When we were your age, we already had you. When we were your age, we had built a house of our own. When we were your age, we had a stable job. When we were your age..."", when you were my age, the country wasn't going to the dogs. When you were my age, the country wasn't going to run out of water in the next 5 years. When you were my age, things weren't as politically fragile as they are today. When you were my age, the economy hadn't collapsed from top to bottom. When you were my age a huge, unemployed youth population wasn't out either protesting for more jobs or slitting each-other's throats for one. Your time was different. Accept it and move on. wtf are you supposed to achieve at 19? I sought my father's approval for the first 24 years of my life. In the last 6 months, I've been depressed and suicidal due to feeling like there was no hope for happiness in my future. 

I realised any father who put his daughter in a position to choose between her own happiness and pleasing him, is not a good parent.

Stopped giving a fuck about his approval. Took a lot of time and therapy. But it worked. Against his desires, I moved out of the country to find a future for myself and I'm struggling financially. I struggle for food. But I'm happier than I've ever been in all my life. 

Seeking validation and approval lead to no where. There will always be someone brighter, better and wealthier than you that people will compare you to. They will never be proud of what you've achieved and they don't need to. You need to be happy with yourself. And honestly that has changed my life. I never thought I could be that person.

Edit: I'm 25 and know how to drive because I got my license but never drive a car because im not confident. 19M, with a drop year (in the first year itself). Under average in studies. Physically ugly. Virgin, never kissed or hugged. Had girlfriend for 1.5years and turns out it was one sided from my side. Can't drive car but I can ride Activa. Have a really supportive bestfriend but I don't treat her right. My behaviour goes toxic when anyone proves me wrong. I feel your pain. But if you're willing to learn, find a  quiet place and a friend to help(if you can) and wake up early, like 4 - 5 am early and learn it. It should hardly take 6-7 days. I'm 21, have a job but am lazy as fuck ,very poor with my finances & afraid that I'm gonna end up alone First time huh? I hear that rant everyday, its to the point where it doesn't even affect me, i practically live with existential crisis and top that with being an introvert, no one is perfect but our society doesn't understand a simple fact that not everyone can become the top 2% in a rat race that only favours the academically superior, but we apparently can't do anything do about it so just go with the flow, pretend it's the rainy season of your life, it'll pass and the sun will shine one day, just keep on trying I am from pakistan and faced same issue. I am 29 now and after finishing bachelors(8 years ago) I had hard time getting job like everyone else. My father used to mock me each and everyday that you are a failure and you will never achieve shit in your life. He used to say so by comparing me with one neighbor guy who got a good job as a developer. I had skills and did job which I quit after 6 months because my boss was a dick. I had been full time freelancer soon after my studies and when I started earning more than that “developer neighbor” then all the mockery stopped all of a sudden and I became their most faithful and successful son. I am currently doing my dream job outside country and living in company’s provided apparent with family. I will never forget those mockeries and will never have respect for my father which I wish I could have I'm 16....got rejected by my crush day before yesterday....self esteem is pretty low...and seeing others like me on reddit makes me genuinely happy. it's interesting as a Canadian of Indian immigrants seeing the youth of India questioning aspects of Indian culture.  It's similar to what kids of expats went through when our parents first moved away.    
Not that the globe is smaller and ideas proliferate so quickly, Indian youth are going through the same cultural revolution that we dealt with.  Still one foot firmly planted in tradition while the other desperately dragging itself to a new reality  
I only offer the advise that stay true to yourselves.  There is merit in buying into the system, but don't be defined by it.  Play music, draw pictures and do the other things that are ""frowned"" upon cuz ""ye saab se paisa nahi aiga"".   
I also understand better the pressures previous generations felt, and so it's natural for them to push on to their kids.  Treat your parents with kindness, for they know not what they do .. they too are struggling with how the world has changed before them Bro start driving using a small automatic hatchback. It's so easy to drive and also have big red 'L' stickers on your car , you can remove it once you learn how to drive. Usually people understand when they see the 'L' sticker and will give you way and won't criticize you. Wake up at 5 am and learn to drive on empty roads first, once you get the hang of it go into usual traffic. I have seen people drive with L stickers for even upto 6-8 months. But make sure you learn to drive a car before you finish college it'll be absolutely necessary. Even experienced F1 drivers would be scared shitless when they drive for the first time in Indian traffic. I screwed up and failed my car driving test and that's saying something, as our country's driving test is an absolute joke and is perhaps, one of the easiest tests out there, in this world of ours.

This happened when I was around 19 years of age (almost 5 years back). I mean, I had hopes and aspirations that I would have obtained a license asap, the moment I turned 18. Well, it sucks I suppose, for life to not turn up the way one hopes too, even if they give their darnest best to make it happen.

I guess, my neuroticism and anxiety ruined that test for me, on that fateful day. Prior to reaching the testing grounds, my instructor made me do a trial on the roads, which I did a good job of and he assured me that I'll surely pass the test as long as I maintain my cool and composure.

But, he couldn't accompany me on the grounds and instead, another instructor who had no clue of my temperament and personality came. And he didn't help things for me. For every minor mistake I made, he kept belittling me, dismissing my anxiety and nervous attitude and told me as to how I seemed to be the weakest out there, when compared to other candidates who came along with me.

And thus, I was completely demoralised and failed the test. Everyone present on the ground, were laughing at me for my ineptitude in handling the vehicle. Did not speak with anyone, on that day. I'm 23, and I still haven't learnt to drive. Just saying:  


I was afraid to drive, and have never ridden a bicycle till this summer. I got a job and was about to move to Bangalore. I knew that I had to learn it, and if I stay afraid now, I'll hate myself for this in future.  


So in a span of 2 months, I learnt how to ride a bicycle, then a scooty and a car back to back. Sometimes the motivation comes from necessity. My dad made me drive when I was 19 ( now 21 ) and I got involved in 3 minor accidents and naturally developed a fear of driving cars. I can drive two wheelers fine but they still mock for not being able to drive a car. Honestly this is more because of a breakdown in communication than anything

A lot of Indian parents are great at raising and talking to their kids till they're 12-13 but seem to completely lose it after that

Its important to note that you can't control or govern your kids lives as they get older and that they still need unconditional help and support from their parents

Kids are too afraid of their parents to say no when they get forced into following some field or career and parents are too focused on the future to see what's happening with their kids in the here and the now


That being said the kid themselves isn't blameless.. A lot of bright minded smart kids just lose the will to study/work/perform... And there is little their teachers or parents can do to understand if there is no communication.


As for you OP... If you have a clear idea of what you wanna do in life then let your parents know about it... Let them understand that you have a goal that you're working towards.. An aim that you want to achieve

They may be bullheaded about it but they still want the best for you.. Let me see. 23 y/o, male. 

1. cant drive any motorized vehicle.
2. cant dance, cant party
3. cant be ""social"", some dumb-fuckery by someone always flips me off
4. In a quest to learn as much as possible. so that makes me a prick
5. Dont watch movies.
6. Dont like eating.
7. Dont particularly travelling In big groups. 
8. obsessive planner, not so much on the execution side.
9. One decent relationship that lasted 6 months.

&#x200B;

note: i can and do ride bicycles and I do trek solo (started this recently) 19 , Didn't get into IIT even after taking drop, have zero friends and no accomplishments, Never had a GF , total waste of parents money Dude that pressure will always be there, irrespective of your age. Today it is abt your studies, tommorow it will be abt job, then about marriage and kids. 
I stood up to my dad only after engineering, i finally got the balls to say that i want to do business and not want to work in a MNC.
He listened to me for the first time after that full blown argument.
Now he encourages(read pressure) me to expand my business 😅 Turned 22 today, absolutely no direction in life. Have no idea what I really like doing. Most of us deal with this on a daily basis, correct me if I’m wrong. We could all use a hug right now. 
But only thing that keeps me going is no matter how hard or shitty a day gets, it doesn’t last more than 24 hours. I feel slightly better knowing that. Hopefully this changes the way you perceive things. जब तक गिरोगे नहीं सिखोगे कैसे The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn't mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don't give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. 

Yep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO. If it comes down to something down something along the lines of '""Sharmaji Kya sochenge?""To kahiye sharmaji khud ke baare me soch lein, hum apna dekh lenge.' The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You really are not perfect are you comrade I'm 36 and can't afford a car. Forget driving anything. >I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

That's my description. Except I'm 22 Oh man that line 19 and can't ride a bicycle hit me. I am 20 i wasn't able to ride bicycle but few months back i made up my mind that i will learn after a week i was able to ride a little bit now i can ride a motorbike (not perfect ) . And also i have started focusing on my life i learned c , python and have started focusing on study . I would also like to mention i flunked in maths in 12 so i would like to say its never too late to change. Using my throwaway porn account because I don't want my irl friends to find out about his, ever.

20, Final year of BCA. Since I'm a failure (not engineer), My school friends consider me a failure and try really hard to hide that because that don't want to hurt me (Or maybe I'm insecure, Idk)    

* I still live with my parents, and I regret not living out on my own at least once every week.
* I know I'm not stupid (I'm always one of the first ones to build up logic for a program, I'm good at few things) but I have never achieved anything in my life, used to score \~50% in schools and hence have trouble with my self image in this aspect (If I'm smart who just sucks at studies or if I'm dumb and just pretending to be smart).
* Current college is shitty as fuck, I have grown to hate this city because I want to live away from it.     
* My dressing sense sucks, but I try to mask it with an ""I don't care what I wear"" attitude     
* I'm supposed to be preparing for MCA, which, if done from good college, Is the only way I can start earning. I have studied nothing in last 5 days, And my MCA entrance is 3 months away. I had told my Pune friends that I'll be visiting them around 18th of December, but now I'm having second thoughts because of not studying. I'm not prepared at all for this, I feel like I'm gonna be a fuckup. and the worst part of this is I'm not even trying to change things.
* I have a gaming problem, when I'm left with games, I stop prioritizing things, and play it till everything else is collapsed... Last time I spiraled out on my gaming thing, I ended up scoring really bad for my 12th exams (Hence didn't take engineering)  
* I'm really self critical, self conscious and a self loather (Not proud of it). There is something wrong with me, psychologically, But I don't know what. Parents won't understand what therapy is (Typical ""you're not crazy, try going out more"" mentality, I don't blame them for it). I have planned to get therapy with my own money once I start earning, Which won't be anytime soon.
* I know I won't do it. but I passively think that if I don't settle down by 25 (or atleast start to settle down), I will kill myself  (Again, I won't do it. I have felt suicidal twice in my life, and didn't even try to harm myself those two times.)

I don't even know why I'm posting this here, I guess I just need to vent. 23, graduated last year, was working at a job I'd landed through campus placements.
But quit, because, big dreams, preparing for a very unpredictable exam with no back-ups whatsoever.  
No idea what's going to happen if my plan falls apart. Im 19 and I haven’t spoken to a girl in over 7 months I'm 27 and I'm alone. I'm 19 and I can't speak to someone(immediately) new especially if they are girls or someone of greater my age! I'm 20 and feel you. Financial freedom will get you out of misery. Try doing things that can get you some money here and there. Stock trading and shit. Once you start making enough on the side to help with some expenses at home meanwhile you do stuff for yourself nobody will say shit. I honestly feel like people need to know this one trick. It is a shame that you feel that way. Unfortunately Indian parents have a tendency to push their own fragile ego and aspirations on their kids. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and don't let the things that your parents say get inside of your head. Get a job, become financially independent and move out. Just do not continue to engage in the toxicity of your parents otherwise things will only become worse for you. I am around 40. I moved to Europe decades ago for IT work, which I am still doing. A lot of my friends in India, some didn't even finish school, are now vastly better off that me financially. Two owns businesses and employs 50+ people. At least 6 have amassed so much wealth (land, properties) that they could retire any day they want. I have 20 years left on my mortgage here.

/I am not complaining though, I have a very good life. I'm 26 and I can't drive (but I'm gonna get back to practice soon). Graduated with an engineering degree at 22 from a national top 10 school, but working hard to re-enrol in a good college so I can finally study things I've always wanted to. Have a lean built but never made a serious effort to get a buff physique as I always found gyms expensive. Promised myself I will get over my discomfort and go to the gym every day when I get into college (and finally have time again). 20. Failed 2nd year of med school, taking a break for one year. Dad says he's ashamed of me and wouldn't talk to me. I've been sent to another city because he can't stand seeing my face, or hearing my voice. I can't talk to people my own age or people in general for that matter, even for small talk. I'm overweight. I'm 17 and supposed to crack JEE but don't know shit about solving those kind of problems, JEE starts on 8 Jan, fml 22 and can't drive because I hit my face on an iron fence while learning. Safe to say I'm perpetually petrified of vehicles and fences. 

Also intrusive thoughts. Does anyone else deal with thoughts that'd lead to brutal death while driving without anything even happening or is it just me lol Well I'm a teacher wage about 3000 RS per month 22 year old, lazy but hard working , have a dream of becoming an scientist or programmer but dream crushed by the same people I’m 31 and never been in a real romantic relationship. Wtf is wrong with me. The worst thing is the disappointment more than unemployment you see on the other fucking faces that we've let them down voluntarily & suddenly we become the bad guy 
Fuck this society I'm in my 3rd year of engineering. I feel like a complete shit. My parents are supportive of my decisions, but I give up things when the going gets tough for example Competitive coding and divert myself with porn or reddit.  

I do not have a routine. I lack consistency and discipline. But I want to get rid of this lethargic feeling that I get. Man... I'm loosing control over my actions. Any advise would be appreciated kind Randians. i choose Non medical but i dont wanna join IIT Exams after two days and I haven't completed anything properly. I am 18 and I have zero self confidence and even though I have been a performer before, now I am just really scared of going on stage and its funny because in my life  all I wanted was to be on a stage performing.

p.s. I am a trained dancer. 28 still studying .. [deleted] I am 1.6lpm guy but my failure  count is much more than  success count . Sure, society does put pressure but don't use the anti-thesis to just be lazy. Dream, work for them, else life is just pointless void without real higher purpose anyway. Im 28, scared to drive and still barely know how to drive (Bangalore and Kochi roads are fuckin scary), i always had constant anxiety and social anxiety which made me a life long introvert, rarely spoken to girls and parents are pressuring me to marry anyone, but i dont wanna. Only 1 real friend at the moment while everybody else are just acquaintances.

Also suffer from a genetic disorder that causes inflamations around my spine and pelvis. Almost always in constant pain, and i am afraid to travel to other countries because i need daily medication to control the inflamations. Walking itself can be a huge literal pain in the ass.

On the plus side, i am a kickass programmer and generalist 3d artist who is comfortably independent. 20s, I fell from my scooter once, it wasn't a big fall neither was it very serious but couldn't bring myself to drive a two wheeler again. Learnt to drive my car, once i couldn't start my car on time after the green light and i don't need to explain the commotion i created at that time, which scared me a lot and im too scared to drive now. Also my left leg feels like it will fall off in pain due to me controlling the clutch in heavy bangalore traffic. So im a lazy and untalented according to my parents. Lol ok parents, im your child who has your genes

also using public transport is better for the Environment Bro. Just find out what you really like and work towards it. It might be against their will but that's how you can give an answer to them and to the society. 20 and still confused if I want to become a software engineer or a musician. I mean I love both but I'm not very good in either of them. :( Rather than think about what you are not good at, think about what you like and are good at or can be good at.
You don’t judge a horse by how fast it swims and a fish by how fast it runs.

If you are not good at studies, maybe you like cooking, or art, or sports, or gardening etc.

Find your passion...
Don’t let a negative opinion define you. This website is weird AF.

\> I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports

Sports? Never knew Indian parents gave two shits about sports. Play anything, you will get flying HC Verma on your face This is all a direct result of Capitalism tbh. Indians parents are one of the worst in the world. I'm n years old, and I can't do a lot of things - but unlike the losers who don't want to put in the effort to be able to do those things, I genuinely want to improve, and am working toward being what I expect myself to be, instead of whining about it on the internet. In the mid-20s. Unemployed for over a year. No social life anymore. Skinny, tall and bald. Very anxious about everything. I'm good at driving, just anxious. Failed driving test. 23 and hate myself to the core. I had social anxiety so talking to others really makes me nervous. I am so perfectly imperfect. I'm in my late twenties and I'm rediscovering life after nearly a decade of depression.

I'm still depressed, of course, but I don't have to let that define me, or dictate who I am or my actions. I've been depressed so long that my childhood memories seem like they happened to someone else. Like I was an observer to my own childhood.

But eventually the clouds will clear, even if it seems impossible. We will never be perfect, but we will bear our crosses and carry on. Because that's life. Suffering, peppered with moments of joy, pain, heartbreak, melancholy, and loneliness.

You'll be alright. We all will be. Its perfectly fine to be self-aware and being comfortable with yourself. But more importantly its necessary to try and fail rather than just being a silent observer and judging other's opinions. If you have anything that keeps you awake at night, you must pursue that coz it's the effort that counts more than success usually. I dont like any sports thats just okay. But ARE YOU AN ENGINEER ? Abey fuck same Logged in to tell you this. I learnt to cycle at age 28 and now I often bike 30 kms to work. Hang in there dude, you'll get there.! The way you wrote your post. It seems you stopped before you even started. 


You weren't joking when you said you weren't perfect comrade I am 21, I'm scared to learn to drive a car. I also sometimes feel like I've wasted myself academically to the point that there's no climbing back up for me. I also put off seeing a psychologist cause I feel anxious to even go lol I moved to Canada when I was 22 and long story short, I fucked some things up and came back to India 2 years later. Now I'm 25, battling depression, still unemployed but trying my best, listening to parents' whining almost every Sunday.

So, you're good! I am 23, and not able to drive a bike, recently learnt to ride scooty on street. I am graduated and got a decent job with decent pay. Yet, so doubts that not able to interact and have a deep conversation with anyone easily. Lonely af. Still life is beautiful. I have been a "" Sharma ji ka beta"" Kinda guy in whole life. So can't even complain. :). I like how OP is talking about accepting ones faults while the comments are filled with suggestions on how to fix that fault. 

Thanks for proving his point? I'm 30, fat(29 BMI) and haven't gotten promoted in a looooong time! I am 21 and i cant talk to girls. Yea the irony being ( in relation to the post) I know what iam doing but it ain’t progressing. 

Fingers crossed As someone who's disabled and struggles with mental health, I've had a lot of other things happen in my life that has made me feel in similar ways. 

&#x200B;

I have developed a very anticapitalist mindset as a result. Fucking wholesome this thread. I'm 26, graduated in hotel management, decided not to pursue the career, did MBA in marketing didn't wanted to do field work, did digital marketing course, didn't liked it, so here i am, working in a KPO as a fresher, on minimum wages, clueless of what I am going to do next.... Oh and did I tell u that I am socially awkward and a virgin who never had a girlfriend, yeah that and I sometimes hope for an alien invasion so that my society's focus diverts from me! I'm 19 (M)

First year at IIT. 

Severe body dysmorphia that I tell no one about. 

An ldr that I'm desperately invested in. 

No friends in college. 

Read incel websites and find myself agreeing with bits and pieces of it. Feel terrible immediately afterwards. We all Drew a tangent to the op conversation. I have heard countless stories of your loved ones comparing you to someone else. I feel so hopeless for such loved ones of mine they have spent all of their life comparing crying and living to fit in the society. “You have to this to make good name” “what will society think” “will you go marry a girl pf different caste and make us look like we raised a fool” The core message is *stop living for people and society start living for yourself*. I hope to get this in my grand pa’s head someday! You just copied my situation, although I'm 18, not 19. Guess some things about boomers never change. You are not trying to achieve and like to stay remain where you are so, not taking any chance to do new thing. Thats great. People should accept you. You are normal. Don't listen other. Do what you want. I dropped out for 3 years and did nothing with that time 19, studying BSc and still wanting to be an artist even though its impossible for me. Seeing all the people who are scared to drive I think you could also blame Indian roads and driving practices. I too hate driving because I have a terrible attention span. But it's doable as long as you take enough caution. I am trying to loose weight since 2006, I am 26 😢 The other day I saw fuckin rickshaws drive on the footpath , ofc now I'm scared to drive I'm 19 and I'm in college and I just feel numb most of the time and I'm lacking self esteem and have zero ambition in life. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this but I'm going to fucking get out of this shitty state. That’s just bad parenting - showing that your parents aren’t perfect either :) I'm 18, and feel isolated in most social situations. The few people I am close with to the point where this isn't a factor are toxic and make me a worse version of myself. I want to make better, more meaningful relationships but my low self-confidence and insufficient social aptitude make it difficult.

&#x200B;

:') I am 22, overweight, and procrastinate alot I am 17 and very socially awkward. I have trouble talking with strangers and making new friends. I am 18 and just want to die. I'm 19 and I forget to take towel with me to the shower . Hi maybe i can advise u on what u can do. Can i ? I'm 20, I've given NEET 2 times and I haven't got in. *""The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.""* --Mahatma Gandhi Okay guys, I will start practicing driving yet again this week.. I've been neglecting this due to the anxiety of driving a car after I near drove my car into a marsh People who complain about a generation forget who raised them. Expectation is a two way street. I'm 19 and I've lost interest in life. Don't give a fuck about anything, not even my parents. I haven't cried properly in 4 years thanks to extreme bullying and shaming in high school. Don't get me wrong , I love life. Suicide is the last thing i will ever think about. But , I just want to have more confidence  in myself. I'm completely emotionless, have 0 interest in life in any aspect. I don't play any game more than 3 minutes, don't read a book or a topic more than 2 lines and give up on a task even before I start.  I just want to feel an emotion. that'd be good. I am 21, too chickenshit to drive or ride a bike, thinking about dropping out of post grad I am 23 and I was super scared to drive in India. While my friends had their licenses and driving their cars, I used sit in the back seat. It's only when I moved abroad I learnt how to drive. Oh and I also dont know how to ride a bicycle, bike or even swim."" I'm 19 too and I can't think anything else other than just killing myself. I'm 29 and I've not saved my first million ₹ yet. 22. IIT graduate. Didn't learn a thing about Engineering. No idea what to do with my life. I can relate, buddy. 
Indian parents expect their children to be like satya nadela or Bill gates. 
When we tell them that we can't, they come up with bullshit stuff like - 'look at that guy, he had nothing and now he is -insert a high level title-' 
Or  ' We sacrificed so much for you, at least do this or that' Hey dude I feel like I've done nothing many times - especially when I perform lower than what others expect (which is your case I believe).

If thinking that ""Indian society is shit and makes you feel shittier"" makes you feel better, be it. Sometimes having a certain opinion about something can make us fell better. 

However, you can't hate on your parents, or as a matter of fact, any blood relation always. I try to convince myself by thinking that most Indian parents care more than parents in other cultures do. It has its advantages and disadvantages. I'm sure we do get a lot more moral support sometimes (not all) than others. But sometimes over expectations leads to such situations.

Edit: corrected spelling I am 23 (M). Here are some of my flaws/failures:

1. I didn't complete a B.Tech. from IIT or a B.Sc. from St. Stephen's. I could never sort out my priorities as a teenager so I ended up attending a ""decent-ish"" DU college instead. 

2. I do not work for McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Amazon, or Google. My family believes that I am competent enough to reach great heights, and I try my best to make them proud, but so far my path has only been full of disappointment.

3. My girlfriend, whom I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, grew uncertain about the future of our relationship so I ended things on a bitter note. In hindsight, maybe I couldn't handle all the stress and acted rather impulsively. I still think about how I could've done better in that situation.

4. I've got no real friends whom I can depend upon to always have my back. There are plenty of friends, but no one who will sit with me and genuinely inquire about my problems. I guess I might've taken the nicest people that came into my life for granted, and now it's impossible to completely fix that even through honest apologies.


It sucks to have to deal with all this, but I've somehow learnt to find happiness in the small things. More importantly, I choose to focus on becoming a better version of myself everyday and not get too affected by my past. Maybe, there is a bigger plan that's laid out for me and I just can't see it yet? Who knows... 25 M, cant drive, extremely overweight(borderline obese), no zero ambition or drive for anything in life. Constant complainer and down in the dumps dummy [deleted] My friend is 30 years old at this moment.
He has never driven a motorcycle in his entire life so far.

Wholesome comments, wish to see this kind of conversation. I’m 25 and unemployed. My younger sibling is employed. I’m just a waste. . ! I am 17. And i feel so lost in life. I am 22 and single for 2 years"

Sports,Hotstar video quality is total crap,147,e006q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e006q5/hotstar_video_quality_is_total_crap/,69,"I've got a 100mbps connection which plays Netflix, Prime YouTube at full hd or even 4k (YouTube only) absolutely fine. But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

App: Hotstar Android
Phone: Samsung Note 9

I don't know. It kind of looks as if Hotstar is trying to save bandwidth costs. Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations). But now it seems that they have decided to remind the customers - you get what you pay for. Only if Disney wasn't pumping all the latest shows there, I'd have switched away long time ago.",skynil," Imagine having to watch F1 on that. Low bitrate

This is why people pirate

They need to upgrade their hardware No, it's not just you. Hotstar's steaming quality is absolute shit. Makes me really appreciate Netflix. Those guys are miles ahead of everyone else when it comes to their streaming tech. Hotstar has shit content if u ignore HOOQ HBO. 

You can directly but HOOQ subscription btw I feel this. Cunts have the worst streaming platform. YT/Netflix streams 1080p smoothly but hotstar still buffers at 480p. As someone who follows EPL, I really wish there was an alternate option to Hotstar! Pay for hotstar and pirate HD if you feel bad about pirating. You've done your part, and avoided the shitty quality and logo that exists for fuck-what reason. 

And the content discovery is so shit. I have to check just watch.in to see what available. The top movies on my screen has The Hunt for Osama bin laden for the last 6 months. Is this a top movie? Who the fuck is watching this? It's a cheap documentary for fuck's sake. Why is nobody talking about the forced cropping to 16:9 on every Hollywood movie? This shit sucks. I have no problems streaming Hotstar on my Android TV, but on other devices like my phone and laptop, it absolutely sucks. Quality is good on computer but on Android it sucks...I sent them an email regarding this but no one replied. Even on HD setting, quality is worse (I was watching live cricket match at that time and it was 3-4 months back). And I thought they are providing low quality to the viewers without subscription so I took the sports pack but quality was still poor. It’s very apparent in darker scenes and you can literally see the pixelation in the areas with shadows. Also they somehow manage to fuck up the color and white balance. I mean the blacks appear dark grayish for some reason. 

Unfortunately it’s the only source for many classic HBO shows so I kind of live with it. Their web UI isn't that good either. Do you guys get irritated by how, when autoplaying the next episode, the video player would exit from full screen mode.

Content wise Netflix is the king(atleast for English content) [deleted] Their iPad UI is equally shit. No PiP mode. Can't see the time/date while playing video. But their Mahabarath does not have Subs 😤 🙁 😭 Mate it's what you get for what you pay! Welcome to India....Oh wait, you're Indian...you know the drill! I use Hotstar everyday. My video quality always remains on high and I get really good quality. This is on the desktop site though, I never use the app. I feel like Hotstar's quality varies with shows and streams. Whenever I am watching a game or watching an English TV show the quality varies from trash to garbage. But whenever my mom starts watching her Indian TV shows, it plays at the highest possible quality without any hiccup. Hotstar is crap!

FTFY I doubt thats even 480p. Probably 360p at max. It also has the worst compression I have ever seen on an OTT platform. The blacks get absolutely crushed and the audio (specifically dialogues) often get distorted.

(I watch on macbook, android phone, and windows pc with studio monitors, and they all have the same problems) I have a 40 Mbps connection and hotstar works well, usually in full hd on my fire tv and pc i dont use it on android. sometimes it buffers when net usage is high but quality never goes below 720p Pay and pirate"
Sports,Elon Musk says import duty playing spoil sport in launching Tesla in India,337,cl0haa,https://www.firstpost.com/tech/auto/elon-musk-says-import-duty-playing-spoil-sport-in-launching-tesla-in-india-7097521.html/amp,88,,Kanjar_Ka_Beej," Do we have a consistent policy on EV ? I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don’t wanna import them. Make them here Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. 

Allowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Good. Hopefully, those import duties will stop one of the most exploitative corporation to exploit fellow Indian workers."
Sports,Why isn’t scholastic wrestling not a part of extra curriculum in Indian Schools despite wrestling being a popular sport in Indian culture?,15,dnq7jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dnq7jf/why_isnt_scholastic_wrestling_not_a_part_of_extra/,5,"Wrestling or kushti in hindi seems to be one of the most popular indian sports and martial art of India. The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

And most parents are so overprotective that they wouldn’t allow their ward to train in fear of him being hurt or injured?",The_New_Renegade," Because kushti is very limited to parts of North India, and it's not very common anywhere else.  Sure, if it's popular in a locality, they should promote it there but I don't see kids in Mizoram being as excited about it as Punjab. I can think of two reasons:

1) In india entrance tests are pretty much the key to higher education and career prospects, so there is no point in spending time on sports
2) Not all colleges give admission based on sports quota, unlike western colleges where a number of athletes go to to colleges based on sports scholarship Infrastructure and lack of coaches. Otherwise it is just shortsightedness of the education-focused country. Because many prefer taikwondo or karate."

 [Cobrapost stings 36 Bollywood celebrities in ‘Operation Karaoke-
It claims the celebrities are willing to post messages on their social media accounts on behalf of political parties in the guise of being their personal opinions—all in exchange for money.

](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/02/19/cobrapost-stings-36-bollywood-celebrities-in-operation-karaoke) It's one way of co-opting all the elite into the regime by making them dependent on the regime's generosity. They know that if they criticize or shun the regime, their entire sports careers can be brought to a dead stop, since govt runs all sports federations through connections and influence. It's like the mafia - when the don invites, you go; otherwise.... They were paid money to make a tweet . Nobody knows this? Russia uses bots for political purposes. India uses sportspersons. Nice. One nation one tweet [removed] Next time they are going to use "" Thesaurus this "" We are literally becoming the new China. Jwala Gutta took a stand against the government and now these useless, scum licking motherfuckers have dropped all support to her.

For sportspeople in India, you either tow the government line, or you don't play. Come to think of it... What if the person who included ""text"" on the tweet did that intentionally... Lol #InfluencerMarketing I forgot who it is but Saina Nehwal or PV Sindhu is a big time Modi bhakt.

One of them dedicated a tournament victory to Gobiji, making Bhakts orgasm instantly. 

One thing is sure : They may be champions on the field but are spineless off the field.

Abhinav Bindra and Jwala Gutta are the only ones I saw not being afraid to criticize the ruling party and its actions. But the alternative to tweeting is to bring about a huge social and official shift to kill off ancient oppressive practices and ensure bad guys use their claws only to make jail food. Statues and tweets are the new bread and circuses. Dhanda: ""Sania and PV Sindhu are getting paid for this?.. ruk abhi batati hu"" North Korea in making. Yes, I too serve the Soviet Union. Celebrity sportspersons or movie starts in India have no spine. They're like obedient school children in front of authority. I thank @narendramodi for his initiative to honour and empower women this Diwali by giving these incredible atheletes something to tweet about.

He was so nice, the ladies didn't even need to use their brains, they just had to copy & paste.

awesome, isn't it ? Modiji thinks this will get him votes.

The sheer incompetence they showed in MH / Haryana elections should've opened their eyes, but they won't learn.

If only Congress does a little decentralised to their power structure, we will get a better opposition They don't have a choice, Govt. would destroy them if they don't follow. Unfortunate that these stars stoop so low and lose the respect that we ought to owe them to their hard work and making it to the top. Really shameful and shows where the society is headed. Whose fans ? Woah! Hold up there! Next you are gonna tell me Kohli doesn’t actually like to drink Pepsi ! /s

It’s a paid endorsement, of course  it is! Remember when Amir Khan spoke out? And he was dropped as brand ambassador of a company because of the backlash and nobody stood up for him? 

Well I guess these guys do not want to end like that and lose their endorsements by not complying. Because nobody will stand up for them if they end up as victims of smear campaigns. lol, now people are trolling by Tweeting the same thing. I am afraid #bharatkilaxmi will be trending soon! Fans are idiots for slamming them. Their ire should be directed at the camera whore of an emperor sitting at the top. Should be able to sue them right? For being sponsored and not adding that to the text? All these anti tweets will be removed because govt control the internet, social media platform and minds of all the bhakts. 
#zerofucksfordemocracy Who knows if they don't agree with modi , there lifes might be in danger from BJP goons At least PV Sindhu added Sir 🤣🤣 Wait a minute. Why blame the sports stars. They are being forced to do this. It's like mafia, you do as the don says.

Blame Kiren Rijiju or PMO not the girls who are being forced to do this. So I don't think it's implausible that they could have been threatened with ruining their careers, but I don't know, the message is fine and if the PMO asked them for support who cares? It's not something unthical? Aren't most of us going to be doing the same thing today with happy diwali ? They are sportstars -- not literary geniuses. Cut them some slack, and go home and enjoy Diwali. People find BS reasons to get upset leaving the good causes thaat actually need attention. They slammed them?

Sports,60 thousand fans turned up today to support the Indian football team against Bangladesh.,3417,dib0ns,https://i.redd.it/pkvfka0smqs31.jpg,125,,Poirot17," we should have won against bangladesh .. draw is a tad disappointing. YBK is a great venue to play for the country Isn't this at Salt Lake Stadium? Indians started loving cricket after 83 win... Maybe if the current team could win something big people would go crazy... I truly believe in the next 4-5 years India is going to be a competent side I like the banner with Mohammedan Sporting, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Let's not forget the originals! I was on my way to a late meeting before the match, and EM Bypass that connects the stadium was jam packed with cars and bikes, with Indian flags all over, Flying high. Some of them wore cricket jerseys as well lol but the passion in my city for football is crazy and as a fan I love it. Imagine playing in a world class stadium with jam packed audience chanting football slogans and appreciating every forward pass you make, It feels like home. I love the fact that so many people turned up for the game. Sad that we didn't win but absolutely love the support that was shown to the team. Hey I can see myself!! My small rant about the situation of football in our country: 

You need development from basic stage, And one of the biggest drawbacks for India is the weather then you have diet issues and no proper scouting and organizational structure. I can share a small story that might interest some of you  

I come from a small town surrounded by many Adivashi colonies, During my schooling I was an active football player and I even played inter divisional football for the South Eastern Railways, That time I used to see some Adivashi folks joining us in training and were of the same age but much stronger core to us ( Credit to their hard work and natural diet ), Some of them used to drive a van or rickshaw for the whole day in that summer heat and then came to practice, We still had a hard time beating them, Heck when after 70 mins we looked drained they ran like arrows Over the time as we grew priorities for them changed , I leaned for most they had to earn in order to even put food on the table. I was privileged enough to be able to play but not to pursue,  education doesn't exactly go well with sports and Indian parents in our country, Our coach tried his best to raise awareness and setup small funds from the local shops but in a small town there's only so much you can do, People like these gets lost in the never ending rat race of survival in our country and talents don't get a platform or a chance to prove themselves or gets exposure to actually do anything, be it in training or development. 

We still do not have mentality to attend or endure whole season of football, Let alone the I League. Community Shield etc. ISL is only for a short period of time and tbf it's doing more wrong than good, but still the initiative is good, as no one else fucking bothers.

I still hope one day indian kids will dream of playing football for our country / clubs abroad and people will get behind their players like they do for cricket now.

Edit: retarded typos. A sight to see.. I’d pay to watch this ... tired of paying big bucks to watch euro friendlies. Football is slowly picking up pace in India. With so many young kids attracted to club football in Europe and better focus on training facilities, India will slowly improve its standing. But it's still a long way to go, maybe 10-15 years before we get to the top 50 rankings. ...and got disappointed. A win would've been the true appreciation for the people present.. Nevertheless, good show! Loved the giant poster consisting portrait of 3 players wearing East Bengal FC, Mohonbagan FC, Mohammedan SC jerseys standing in a huddle.. ,😍 This is proud for any nation, for this kind of fan following. Yuba bharati kirangan 🧡 U/manjit2990 did u watch it or to maybe support the BD team against India? ^(/s) The mecca of Indian Football.. people in Calcutta share an equal passion for Football and Cricket. just wish t'was the same in the whole country I'm from Bangalore and support BFC. In the initial seasons, the much talked about West Block Blues held up a banner,that is still held up at major games today. That message is all inclusive and is ever more important now.

""The road is long, but the belief is everything. Stand up for Indian football.""

Never been so proud to see a packed stadium for our games. Unpopular opinion: Team performs better without Chettri.  [SC: We couldn't deliver a performance to match the atmosphere at the Salt Lake last night, and the dressing room is very disappointed about it. We couldn’t capitalise on the chances we got,but this is a process on the pitch and in the stands. You turned up, we'll keep attempting to.](https://twitter.com/chetrisunil11/status/1184295678626779137) Do the people on seats under the big flag get to see the match? Or are those seats empty? 60, 000 there, yet still no comments here. +1 Koi video dikhao bc Amazing Spectacle Keep it up Good news! Love it :) Cuz there are too many of us to go around Soo much support. Yet internationally so behind. 

My take: Sporting culture is minimal. No places to casually play. Courts, grounds, spaces are accessible for the  rich only.  Developed parks have the infuriating ""Park mein football aur ball sports khelna mana hai"" (football and ball sports not allowed).  I have seen people stopped for playing catch with a tennis ball. ""band karo ye!"" ""park ka satyanaash kar diya hai!"" (stop this. Have spoiled the park)

Development, training, diet are obviously important. But loads of countries ahead of india in football have these problems. There definitely seems support for Soccer in India. How has it not translated to something like cricket. This is kolkata we are talking about the turnout is expected. I think crickets popularity will be over within 2 decades because the game is too long as well as boring because it is almost entirely dominated by our country now. And sports like football will rise in popularity but i am not sure if sports will ever be as popular as west in our country because we never had a sports culture in the first place and it is introduced at a time when video games are rising in popularity , and second thing is most of these outdoor sports originated in the west where temperature is cold but in the scorching heat of india i dont know how comfortable it is to play these sports thats why i believe sports like kabaddi are better suited for indian environment and might become popular once again someday or some new indoor sport might be created . JAI HIND Glad that football is picking up in India, but I feel like instead of organising matches in cricket stadiums building more quality football only stadiums and keeping matches there will really be a huge boost to the game here. More fan come to see Kerala blasters play Stop hyping this dumpster team. Indian football is corrupt and will take a 1000 years to even qualify for the world cup. They can't even defeat Bangladesh.. pathetic Virat ne kaisa perform kia? :) Feels like a slutty click bait title. 60k people went to see an interesting match. Not necessarily to “support” India [removed] Can someone explain how Qatar couldn't beat us in their own backyard? Was it the under 14 women team or something that were playing against us that day?

Getting a haircut in your vest was normal in my village, but recently when I was getting a haircut, I didn't want all my hair on my formal shirt, so I removed it, but another guy sitting nearby passed a weird look, as if I were a rube. 

I feel it is more practical, especially when it's hot, because it gets even hotter under the cloth in the salon, and maybe unless you're at one of those expensive judgmental 1.6lpm salons, practicality should come first.

Here in Bombay we just put on a regular tee for a haircut, a hairdressers is a messy place and i wouldnt go for a haircut in a fancy shirt because that would be crazy like going to a sulabh sauchalay in a tuxedo.

I also see quite a few people removing their shirts after the haircut and getting their underarms shaved. Never seen this back in my home town. Yes. Keep your clothes on, please. Remove it.

Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.

Because, soon she would need that help. This is what we need. Brave of her! Don't wanna be that person but

Yasss queen 👑🎊🗿 More power to her, Cheers for Love ♥️🇮🇳 Thats pretty a pretty bold move considering the mindset of most indians towards homosexuality.

There is a really good radiolab episode on her - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee. She discusses about genders and her ban. Good for her. Hope she doesn't get harassed by the wonderful people in our country. Fantastic! What a great role model. It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name. Thanks Is anyone even reading that a 18 year old woman went into a relationship with a 14 year old kid? If this was a straight relationship, the lot of you would be running around with pitchforks and candles by now. Yeah nice. We gotta reason to burn her images. Yay Indians get to work. I wonder why....ahahah I didn't read the full stop after soulmate and thought she was in love with herself. Godspeed! It's a similar situation all over the world. No pro footballer will accept that he's gay ( while he's playing ). I mean, it's brave of her and everything. And I'm totally for it. But isn't she in a relationship with her cousin's daughter? Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares!

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

A good article about it:

> http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2013/7/22/6phssedqppiaxjndh9sxxm3jph49r7",kash_if," I'd say that's when Indian football peaked out. The coming decade was so bad economically that some INFL winning clubs would fold within few years due to lack of proper infrastructure of the sport and fanfare in general. The league barely got any broadcast and only Kolkata/Goan clubs would have any chance of making money.

This decade was a mixed bag, on one end people started taking interest in the sport but on the other end clubs continued to go bankrupt. Goan clubs are simply happy to play in the Goan Pro league whilst Kerala, Kolkata and NE are the only bastions of football."
Sports,How to cope with the stress and toxicity that come with typical Indian working environment?,59,e6c4jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6c4jo/how_to_cope_with_the_stress_and_toxicity_that/,24,"I work in a municipal corporation. Which is a local government body. The work environment is as toxic as it can be. The worst thing is that first I was posted near Nagpur. It was great, people were really nice and respectful. Then I got myself transferred near my hometown, Aurangabad. Everything here is bad compared to my previous working place. My current Boss is an unmarried 50 y.o. woman. She just don't have any filter when she talks. Very abusive and narcissist. I'm incredibly depressed and suicidal. I told my family about this. But, they just want me to get married and be grateful that I have a government job. But, basically I'm dying inside. I don't know what to do.

***

 I wanted to quit but, my father convinced me that I could just take leaves and prepare for another job (I can get another government job within a year. I'm in sports quota). But, now he don't want me to take leaves either. He just wants me to get married as quickly as possible. I was preparing for this another job (It's like PWD job). But, now this new Government of Maharashtra is thinking about scrapping the whole recruitment portal because it was an initiative of former government. I'm very indecisive and fucked up RN.",nikamsumeetofficial," Dont quit unless you have another job in hand. And fair warning, most jobs in India are stressful, especially in the private sector. I forgot to mention that I'm a 26 year old male. From *Maharashtra*. Exercise helps a lot in reducing stress. Also try to inculcate a hobby to just divert the mind. Fantasy novels are great for just losing track of this world and it’s bullshit. You have only one life, don't just waste due to the social and family pressure, leave the job, and try something which you will enjoy doing for your whole life. Do whatever you want to do.... Your parents will not be there when you're old and regretting of what could've been Any option at all to emigrate? Wherever you go in India you are going to face this issue anyway man >How to cope with the stress and toxicity that come with typical Indian working environment?

By leaving this country Why are you letting your father dictate your decisions? Take a transfer back to Nagpur while looking for better opportunities. Meanwhile can you carefully & secretly record (video & audio) your interactions with your boss? This is in case you ever need it as an insurance policy against her bullying.    

Given the current economic and unemployment scenario, I'd advise you to not leave your job unless you have a firm offer in hand.Till then you can try de-stressing techniques like playing your favourite sport,yoga,, or a hobby. They'll also prevent you from slipping into depression. If  you're feeling suicidal, please start individual therapy with a trained psychologist immediately. The psychologist might recommend a psychiatrist to prescribe medication if it's severe. There's nothing shameful or wrong about getting medical help when you need it. 

Your father is less concerned about your mental health and personal happiness than is about 'log kya kahenge' (T: आपले नातेवाईक काय म्हणतील? समाज काय म्हणेल?) because that's probably what he has seen. And maybe he doesn't realise the extent of your depression. What you need to realize, however, is that only if you're happy can you keep anyone else happy. Gray rock him while your transfer/ other job works out. 

I'd also advise postponing marriage till you're a bit more happier in your life. A new wife and in-laws will add to your responsibility and your plate's already full with your unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Also you need to move out of father's shadow and start taking your own decisions before you accept the responsibility of your own family. Or even that life will be dictated by your father's wants and not your needs.

ETA: added a few more thoughts after re-reading your post. In your place, I'd quit.
Whatever you do, make sure it's your decision and not your parents'. No options for another transfer? Or record her abuses and send to media. getting married because of work pressure is like watching Dharmendra's movie (for eg. Loha) to relieve headache from watching Govinda's movie. Find a solution, like transfer or do reverse eklavya. Make an idol/flex poster of her and take your frustration on it. Nothing works like money and/or recommendation to get transferred. don't want to sound rude but i think you didn't have a test of the private sectors which gives just a few pennies in return.

***if you dont fight for yourself, no one will either for you*** jobs in private companies are not different. At least you have job security in government job. Learn to ignore people. > But, they just want me to get married and be grateful that I have a government job. 

This made me laugh hard You are living your life or your father's life? You want something, you have to go get it. OP, not a good idea to be complaining about your boss on the internet, while using a reddit username that apparently looks like a real name. If your boss finds out you've been a naughty boy and telling strangers how bad she is, things could get uglier. Leave the job Arrey, sare sector main yehi scene hai bhai, just go with it."

Preferably, with a budget of not more than 3-4k ?",Android_Arsenal," I don't think any reasonable shoe can last for years, nor is that something to be expected. They take the abuse, so your feet don't have to.

For example, walking shoes are expected to give out after about 700 kms, which should be about a year under regular use. Asics Gel Lyte would last you a long time. Also they're the best for running. Any sports shoe, at long as you don't use it. I have had Reebok, Puma and Fila.

All these have lasted for about 3 to 4yrs atleast. Never had an issue. ASICS Sketchers. They're costly but worth it imho very comfortable too. Been using one pair for about 2 years now.   
I like asics, or you can try Decathalone For general purpose, Puma shoes are good. For running nothing beats ASICS."

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time 😅 Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

>She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy. While profiling Sindhu's career, a correspondent with *The Hindu* wrote:  
>  
>*""The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, travelling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment.""*

Proud of her, she deserves it ❤️ Yesss,This is huge considering she had lost in her previous two final appearances.
  
This is also a ruthless revenge for her narrow loss in the final against Okuhara in 2017 since she beat her in only 38 minutes! bless you, Sindhu. Wonderful effort by Sindhu! Hats off to Pullela Gopichand as well! Awesome she absolutely dominated Okuhara. 21-7 21-7 wow  thumping victory

Edit: (7:00PM) You can still watch the match on hotstar. starts at 2:23:00 mark

Thank you for making India proud Sindhu! She's a true national treasure This was one of the most one sided final I have ever seen. *Akshay Kumar has entered the chat* Amazing. Really proud of her This was sheer perseverance that finally paid off. Congratulations and this has to be one of the proudest moments of not only her life, but Indian sports as a whole. Not to forget, she dedicated this medal to her mother. It was her birthday today. Best gift ever. Congratulations!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu 😍 Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance! 

This one medal was evading her for so long, In 2013, 2014 she won Bronze, 2017, 2018 she won Silver but 2019 she made sure to clinch nothing but Gold...Brilliant and resilient stuff! 👏 [deleted] Her Quarterfinal round with Tai Tzu Ying was a hard fought win, she lost the first round, but went on to beat her in the next 2 to move to Semis. The last 2 sets were pretty close scores too.

Edit: /s -_- Cricketers can go suck a.... Not sure why we guys are so good at individual sports but terrible at team sports. And before you come at me, Cricket (a game) can't be counted as a team sport.

Congrats to Sindhu nevertheless.

EDIT: Thanks for the downboats. Forgot I was in /r/india. You guys can defend it all you like, only 12(?) fucking Commonwealth countries play the 'sport'.

Sports,India’s Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,2105,cvxqea,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,90,,babloopachisya," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It’s an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let’s see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogotá Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! [deleted] All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great...

Sports,"Guys, I am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of India!",38,e3b9rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e3b9rc/guys_i_am_disappointed_in_the_way_we_exploit_the/,11,"We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat. We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!


^^^*only ^^^poor ^^^illiterates ^^^count.",Rocky_since1951," Apparently, 30% of the population is below poverty line. That is they live by dollar a day. A lot of time we don't see them because we live in a bubble. Your security guards and waiters mostly come from Bihar and NE. And there are much lesser jobs our countrymen do. Its the middle class that is getting the D in india was that an attempt at mocking the underprivileged?  

>lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy\* by locking up the poor!  
>  
>\*only poor illiterates count. >Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months

Wrong fact.

Just get one thing straight, it doesn't matter however targeted programmes you run, there is only one way to remove poverty, that is is rapid economic growth. Rising tide lifts all boats. You may not want it but the country needs 10 more Mukesh Ambani’s so that they can employ millions and thus there is some hope for some people. Just see Chinese example, they didn't care about people opinions, they picked them from villages, provided them jobs, housing, medical and thus created chain of people coming out of abject poverty.

Though I am well aware this can't be implemented in India. Please stop being sarcastic in that way. Your intentions may be good but let's not make a joke out of all this. 

Poverty alleviation programs and family planning programs are already in place. Things hopefully, will get better. Hi,

So I feel the same way. You can't really change generations of class divide, however change yourself.

Treat everyone with respect. I say thank you and sorry to watchmen, chefs and Walters and try not to disturb them too much. Just be kind and understanding to all. Try not to dress too fancy all the time. Remember the zeros on the left side of your net worth matter alot, but after a while the zeros on the right and side matter less. 

Try to live a humble life. Never waste food or try to do so if possible. Try to use public transport and just be nice person who doesn't show off his or her money or parents money. Just don't give money in charity, but time also by volunteering for a cause you think you are good at. You don't know how many lives you cand drastically improve indirectly. I get confused with the term ""poor people"" offlate. At least, majority of those who qualify under the ""poor people"" category in cities don't really fall under this group as they earn really well, but in ""unaccountable ways"" aka without any taxation. How they spend their money is a different matter though. Most of these poor people earn a hand full in cities or don't earn because they are lazy (and not because of lack of opportunities). 

I feel every time I get exploited by these ""poor people"" rather than I exploiting them - it starts with almost everyone who fall into this BPL category and they will try to extract as much as possible from you or cheat you or want to get away with half baked work. Take your maid, auto driver, road sweeper, vegetable seller, construction worker, etc etc etc.. Just this evening, I am fooled with poor quality apples in spite of paying the amount he asked for it. 

PS: i am specifically referring to these fake poor people in cities and not the real poor, mostly outside big cities & towns, who struggle to meet ends inspite of hard work."

Sports,Your thoughts on e-sports,51,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,48,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",SlapMak," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental. Even though I love playing video games, Sports for me is still something physical. Sports? Are they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit? Lol"

There’s lot more issues. What do you all think is wrong? The education system, the parenting, or the environment? 
Though India has the second highest population in the world, we are not doing anything great (Pardon me if it offended anyone). There are no big achievements in terms of sports, education, or music, anywhere for that matter. Are there no talents here?
Let’s discuss, we are the ones that are going to run the country in the future. We need to know what can be changed!",Shutthefrontdoooor," Resources vs population ratio is very very low. See mostly how insensitive people are to other people is the reason. I have observed how people have this urge in themselves to judge others and think bad of them is, and I too have been there. Being grown up that way, maybe everyone has. 

Parents are insensitive to their children, most of them just have them coz society tells them to else they don't give a damn how is their child especially mentally, when its college time they order them to do a specific course as if they know the best while they don't know a single thing about their child. Yes there is change coming in this behaviour but there is still majority who will say it's bullshit and they own their children. They say that their children must study what they want them to, score what they want them to, love who they want them to and marry. Their talent is constantly suppressed at every step to the level they just become a follower when they had capability to be a leader.

Man is supposed to be loved and respected by his family even if he beats his wife, shouts at his children, have no social life whatsoever and is completely not understanding. 

People say their is equality but obviously they have to constantly remind themselves which group other person belongs to so ofcourse there is huge negativity to question of intercaste or interreligious marriage which inturn is best solution to vanish discrimination.

Even our newspaper do this discrimination, just read matrimonial section there, women needs to be fair always, less educated than groom always, have to cook, and will have to obey the order when family says no to work and ofcourse has to be of same caste and religion.

Man and even women believe girls are to be controlled that when they ask for freedom they deserve to be raped. There is so much filth in minds of people.

We are constantly been forced to love our parents no matter how wrong they are, respect elders no matter how bad their deeds are and on top of them believe in God that he will do everything good. Well I can say is society wants us to just support and obey things blindly and most of them are pathetic. As a country, we are just at that stage. Every country goes through a phase like this. But we have technology. It's up to us as to how we use the tech to make or break us. I won't even say religion. I'd say the caste system is a really fucked up thing than most people realize. My imaginary friend is better than your imaginary friend Indians are what is wrong with India. Herd mentality with rigid perceptions I think you're comparing India with first world countries. And let me remind you that even first world countries faced these issues when they were young. Every country has its issues no country is perfect. Even the first world countries have misogyny, racism & rigging, etc. 

India is a young country compatriot. It's still evolving and rest assured it'll shed all those features you've mentioned and will become an ideal country.

Jai hind. My mom started clapping once the verdict was out. And she said that India belongs to Hindus and that Muslims must be driven out. I'm just speechless. I don't know what to do.. I told her that it's such a backward thought. She didn't care. She just sat down to pray.

I can't believe it. Ostensibly people also have a restricted mindset, they are not open to changes.Cant blame anyone though, we have always been thought to not do mistakes, to follow the rules, trying something new is at our own risk.People, inclusive of me sometimes, deny to change their beliefs that we have held dearly are have been comfortable with. Vaanar Raaj Religion. To many religious issues interfering with country issues What's wrong with India is that we didn't have a mass movement to get to level of high values of integrity in it's people, as a society. 

The same aspect for which the subcontinent was once famous for, before this country was looted, it's people exploited, before there were artificial famines where millions died, before there were foreign invasions, organized rape and loot. Societies take a hit in various ways from that. Societies tend to become misogynistic, racist and overly religious in such cases. Political games and vote bank politics from all sides don't help either. I not defending anything here, just looking at the psychological, societal aspects of it. 

Given all that, even though I see a lot of less than ideal behavior, in terms of sexist, racist behavior of people, I see that we are quickly moving to a more equal society, there is good growth.
Yes, there still are horrific incidents, if you look at statistics though, the percentage is going down in most cases.

Going through all this over the centuries, it is a miracle of what level of goodness our societies still have, whatever level it is at. Everything needs an overhaul. Social upbringing of the kids. How we teach and parent them. It should start from there. Be kind. Accepting. Instead of breaking rules set examples. The list can go on. But yes we need a total change. What is wrong with you? You mean to say that we do not have big achievements in sports, education or music? What parameters do you consider for signifying achievement? India has respectable achievement in sports such as Cricket, Hockey, Badminton, Billiards, Chess, Kabaddi,etc. We have achieved a lot in Music too. Your statement undermines the variety of Indian classical, folk, Sufi and even modern day music. Do I need to speak about education too? Even though we were literally fucked up by imperialist powers/invaders for hundreds of years, we have managed to achieve a lot in the last 70 years and we are going to do so in the coming years. Our grandparents and parents main focus was Roti, Kapda and Makan. Two entire generations have spent their lives in achieving basic human and physiological needs. Once these needs are fulfilled with stable means of sustenance, creativity and ingenuity will definately flourish."
Sports,I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough,31,dup4ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dup4ed/i21fcant_decide_if_my_bf28m_is_showing_red_flags/,35,"Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

Tl;dr Can't decide if my bf is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough",sabthefabk," You two are not a match.

There is nothing wrong in your expectations, or his behaviour. They are all choices people make. He seems certain about what he wants. You too, are certain, and when he crosses those lines, you are uncomfortable.

A relationship is about compromise. But compromise even if grudging initially, has to finally become one of happy acceptance. Otherwise, the insecurities will eat away at it slowly. He doesn't seem to be particularly compromising to me. You seem to be compromising, but very uncomfortably.

If possible, meet a therapist. Have a few sessions. A good therapist helps you clarify your own feelings and communicate them to yourself. That will help you decide. Is r/India going to be a relationship consultancy sub? Wow, this is a toughie.

Your insecurity is very valid, but at the same time, I can't really see anywhere your boyfriend incurred any serious red flags.

I'm sorry about the way his female friend / coworker treated you, that isn't right and you were right to ask him to not meet with her anymore (I would never date anyone whose friends gave me any racist comments of any kind, and I'm sure it wasn't in a joking manner). So kudos on that, and as for the instagram thing, I wouldn't worry too much unless he is known to be very active on Instagram (many people just have the app installed and look at it from time to time, not really paying attention to who they follow or who is following them).

Here is where the real advice for you lies:

When your boyfriend was vacationing in Las Vegas for hiring escorts and visiting strip clubs, you said, in your own words, and I quote: ""Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.""

I can understand giving your partner space, but giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club even if it makes you uncomfortable reeks of insecurity. If giving your boyfriend permission to go to a strip club makes you uncomfortable (I would very much be uncomfortable with my partner going to a strip club, even with friends) then ask him to stop (this is a very legitimate request and especially more so in your case, since you two are thinking of getting married soon).

Going forward, I would ask what your boyfriend is doing in Miami (as well as any situation), and I want to ask yourself:

Am I uncomfortable with where my boyfriend is going and what he is doing? If yes, why?

If you have a legitimate reason (hint: escorts and strip clubs are very much a legitimate reason).

Then address it to him in a clear, straightforward manner. Remember, communication is key in relationships and marriages.

As for whether your boyfriend's friend is a good influence or not, it's tricky (namely because you may not like the lifestyle, but the other party is free to make their own choices), because on one hand, you may think they aren't, but another hand, you don't want to overstep your boundaries (telling your partner that a friend is a bad influence can be seen as controlling unless the friend has been known to inflict emotional and / or physical pain on your partner). So I wouldn't worry too much (about the friend) until the friend puts a strain on your relationship (which makes it pertinent to discuss what you think about him).

So going forward, I would advise you communicate to your partner about how you feel where he is going and what he is doing, don't be afraid to have a discussion on it.

Communicate. Communicate. Communicate. He seems to simply be from a more.....liberal(?) background than you. There will be unavoidable culture shock involved.

Just ask yourself whether you can tolerate it, then discuss it with your fiance. Following that, you may also talk to your own friends and family to ease matters.

And good luck. :) Now is the time to contemplate and avoid any forseeable emotional trauma. It is difficult to understand what your or your bf thinks since its not clear of both of u are born and bought up in US or born in India and are living in US for last few years or born in Indian and moved to US as child. That defines the characteristics and let other understand the mentality.

As an Indian guy living in US, it is common to be attracted to the western culture and be able to be a part of it. Getting a lap dance is a common practice but escort is not. When a bf or gf starts making comments on things that their partner hadn't thought about, it is normal for your partner to panic. He might genuinely being a friend with that woman and your comment(s) may made him think you were narrow minded that led him to not tell you everything.

That being said, these type of situations are typically paradox for not knowing the other end of story. The best I can or I believe anyone can suggest is to express yourself and how you feel to your bf. If you've had enough understanding of him, you'd feel or realize if there was a lie. Just don't jump onto any conclusions. Do your best to understand what he's really doing. You're not ready to be married.

Enjoy life, try to find someone who is matching you. Who goes to Vegas on vacation and doesn't go to a strip club? What is this world coming to? > I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.

Which is good

> Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.... My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.

Well, you didnt tell him not to so he didnt.

I guess you wanted him to realize that you want him to stop, by himself. That hasnt happened. You should say so.

I dont see any red flags tbh. But, for someone living in the west you are pretty conservative. He isnt as conservative. And that makes for a bad match. OP, do you really want to spend your life worried that your partner might cheat on you? There are plenty of decent human beings (like your partner, I’ll assume it’s a good person with a different lifestyle), who may lead life the way you do. 

&#x200B;

You are 21. You are going to spend hours and hours in a high-pressure job. No one is forcing you to marry someone who’s lifestyle doesn’t work for you, so why do this to yourself? It’s only a matter of time before you start getting gaslight for felling the way you feel. Why put your future at risk?

&#x200B;

Being a hardworking person with different interests is fantastic. Best of luck. You guys have a communication problem. 

Me and my SO are opposites. But we got through stuff by being straight forward with each other. But politely. Not  “how dare you go to strip club..”

But “I’d really appreciate it if you wouldn’t go. I feel disrespected .....” This is bullshit! You posted a Similar story a few months back! I actually DM'd you to give you advice on multiple occasions. What is your problem? Do you just wan the attention. Seek therapy I maybe sounding too judgmental but looks like you've had a sheltered social life. Your 20s are your time to live and do crazy things. Going out till 3AM, partying etc., this is what most people in their 20s do (at least those who live in cities), let alone in the States. You don't seem to do any of that and have perceived notions of what partying entails.

> Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?

Having a good time doesn't make you a bad person. 
Also, have you even talked about marriage or is this all in your head ?

You need to realize why you're uncomfortable with all this. Do you not trust him which makes you imagine bad scenarios in your head ? 

With the girl scenario, nothing good will come out of being too controlling. It's frankly quite unattractive. If he does indeed like her would you want to be with him ? If he does indeed like you then he will automatically draw the boundary when required. You need to be secure and let the chips fall how they will.

Also, try to go out more. It's fun. Keep All options open. If he is playing you on reserve and not curbing his activities. Why don't you try find a better alternative?
He is immature for sure. Plus the religion card always looms ahead for argument sakes.
Be brave confront him, sound your ideas to him. If he doesn't love you enough then why marry someone like that?"

But which change hasn't been noticed by People?,purifiedhuman," Our language of wealth hasn't caught up with inflation

I remember watching movies in the 2000s where they would refer to being rich as having a crore rupees or being a crorepati

Now in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, a crore doesn't even get you a house

Like in Hera Pheri where they want to scam 20 lakh and think that will set them up for life. 20L doesn't even pay for a MBA degree now The night sky, yes we can no longer see the stars in their full glory because of pollution/Light pollution, sadly people do not even realise  this. I work in payments. The scale at which India had adopted mobile and digital payments is just amazing. We literally use to hear at my workplace what a huge opportunity Indian market is a few years back and recently came across one report that said market in Tier 1 urban india is getting saturated.  Payments app/Mobile wallets are fighting for single digit market shares. 

This being said - we still have a long way to go. There is a segment of our population that still relies on cash and is unbanked. Companies are trying to figure out how to make a sustainable business model in this segment. Roads have become much much better Lots of teens are into fitness and sports than a decade back.Parents don't shy away from enrolling their wards into sports other than cricket and football.

Food,"Movie-goers can carry their own food, water bottles to theatres, reveals RTI query",579,e87w4z,https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/movie-goers-can-carry-their-own-food-water-bottles-theatres-reveals-rti-query-113719,54,,shashank1706," I'll clarify it for everyone here. The RTI query is about food and beverages being taken into movie halls being a crime. Police said it isn't. That's an obvious thing.

However *security at the movie halls have a right to deny entry if you carry food inside because it is a part of the contract with the owner of the establishment who owns the movie hall, who has right of denial of services based on implications, in the same way that you're not allowed to bring and eat outside food when you enter restaurants lest the restaurants become picnic spots.*

RTI query was if so and so is a crime. Its not. RTI query also, does not decided civil law or law of contracts. Its just a query. **Now don't go around fighting with Movie Hall security guards. You may be committing a crime then if you do that. Causing public nuisance and all.**

Note!: If however the denial of entry based on carrying food is not implied in the contract for watching the movie, a civil suit may lie and if a bye law exists under the municipal code or commercial regulations that make it illegal for them to deny entry based on carrying outside food, then you may be able to lodge a complaint provided such a law exists in the jurisdiction that the movie hall is in but if no law exists that makes it illegal, you have to listen to what the owner and his security guards say. **Their place, their money, their rules.** wait a second, so when the theatre stops me from letting me get inside with a water bottle, I'll have to say that the RTI says something else? Lunch boxes in theatres are a bit too much don't you think. \>Responding to the RTI query filed by Hyderabad-based anti-corruption activist Vijay Gopal, the police have clarified there are no curbs by law to carry food and water, and a complaint can be filed with the Legal Metrology Department who will check if there are any violation of law

&#x200B;

Sensationalised article...  if there is no restriction by law, then a complaint can be filed with a department who will check if there is any violation of the law. That does not mean that a theater cannot ban food from being taken into the premises unless

1) There is an explicit law which requires the theater to allow food in the hall

OR

2) There is no policy of the theater against bringing food in and its just the security guards enforcing it on verbal orders

(I believe an explicit law does exist requiring free water to be provided, but nothing for food) 

&#x200B;

After all, there is no restriction by law on an 80 year old guy going to a club wearing just shorts and bathroom slippers, but the club can enforce their own policies. Maybe the theatres shouldn't let people carry food inside theatres but what's wrong with water? Yes! Now I can sing the national anthem while standing and eating my malai kofta! Careful, to my knowledge this a state subject and what applies in Telangana/AP does not necessarily apply to your state. Make sure you are familiar with the regulations prevailing in your jurisdiction. That's why you go to the bay of pirates, have all the aloo paratha you want while watching movies from there. Its not a hospital or school, if you do not like the pricing just do not go to the movies why is cheap food and drink at the movies supposed to be for public good. Nobody is forcing anyone to go watch movies and then buy their pricey offerings, if there is a market for their offerings at their prices why should they reduce the prices or allow outside food and drink. Just snack before the movie Not being a crime doesn't mean it's automatically allowed. Private venues are free to bar moviegoers from bringing stuff in.

From what i understand there's a specific state law in Telangana (and possibly AP as well) that prohibits movie theatres from making these restrictions but that doesn't mean you can pull this shit anywhere in the country. If you do, the theatre is free to tell you that you're not allowed in. End of story"

Despite efforts at petty theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and ""flirting"" with a young prostitute, Soapy fails to draw the attention of the police. Disconsolate, he pauses in front of a church, where an organ anthem inspires him to clean up his life; ironically, he is charged for loitering and sentenced to three months in prison. Err. If he doesn't get charged then he'll just spend a bit of time in police lockup and then kicked out. And prison > police lockup any day.

e: People saying we can't outrage etc, If you cared to look, it's mostly westerners who are outraged on behalf of us.

Also, bit dick of this 'scholar' guy to assume he represent all Americans with ""we pretend it isn't"" as if all of them legit can't stand it and somebody is force feeding them, when in reality it's like guilty pleasure (its thought as smelly,spicy) but many of them can't afford to eat it regularly.

He intentionally used racist-ish words to cause outrage. 

Another tweet recieved similar outrage https://twitter.com/TerryMoran/status/1198408273818537984

These people are what they call 'boomers' who hijack controversial opinions to parade their racist beliefs The replies to his tweets are just weird.   
the man just said about his preference and people are like, ‘i love Indian food and you should love it too, and your are bad person for having an opinion’. I shit you not there are restaurants in Chicago costing $150 per plate (avg per head cost of food and drinks) filled with non Indians enjoying the best butter chicken they had in their life. Difference of opinion isn't acceptable to Indians Lmao, he got what he wanted, which was attention from Indians and the resulting publicity. People having their say on Twitter won't stop, what I don't understand is why it's making the fucking news. It's such a non-issue, surely there are more pressing things to report?

Apparently you're supposed to say boring opinions not actual controversial opinions. Idk what's wrong with people, usse achcha nahi lagta toh theek hena Ya well.....That's like, his opinion, man. Yo the man just didn't happen to like our food, what's the big deal? I think his paper caught fire in morning  🤣🔥 With outrage like this, more people will pretend like they love it. Proves his tweet. For the laziest who aren't going to check the news - he said ""Indian food is terrible & we pretend like it isn't."" The outrage isn't that he doesn't like Indian food, it's about him associating everyone else with him. If he had just said that he personally doesn't prefer Indian food, there wouldn't be this much of a fuss - but this is just a typical case of generalization, & I'm glad that he got owned for it. Lots of people defending indian food in his replies were non-indian as well People are harassing a dude for saying he doesn't like the same food as them. What have we become. Why take everything so personally? Someone said something, people got something to say to him. Absolutely nothing that should be newsworthy. Chill out. This guy hasn't tried Vada Pav and Butter Chicken Yet. Finger licking good. Well he was asked to write something controversial. HE DID THAT. The vast majority of 'Indian' restaurants in the US serve mughalai food which is highly oily and spiced.

More than Indians typically have at home Well Indian food is terrible - have been eating it all my life. Indians jump at the opportunity to defend a white man offending them. If someone asked 'Whats your most controversial dating/sex opinion?' and the answer followed 'Black women are terrible' can you imagine the ~~shitshow~~ shitstorm that would follow? Eh- big deal. So he doesn't like Indian food. He isn't wrong. Everything is so oily and unhealthy. I've been trying to eat healthy and I've realised that there's very little healthy stuff available. Plus everything has so many flavours at once. Indian food in general tastes like food that's been made by a people who only recently came out of starvation and thus decided to throw everything in a pan and eat it because they never had it before I dislike how this guy is entitled to speak on behave of whole nation . He is not even elected representative . Of course people found this to be racist and about white male privilege and shit too. Everything is. No one can have harmless opinions anymore.

Perhaps this Sanghi pig is  jealous because many unemployed Muslim youths are getting employment because of food aggregrators. Hyderabad... Name itself looks Islamic. That guy should move to somewhere like Varanasi. There should be a rule that states that upon such discrimination, the delivery man is legally allowed to eat the ordered food.

ಠ_ಠ

Jokes aside, this is a grave situation.

Sadly, this reminds me of the people in power in Soviet Union, how they fucked the whole country while selling lies and corruption.

As someone recently asked,

>what's the cost of lies?

How long we are gonna lie to ourselves about the situation we are creating not only of ourselves but our future generations. Every sixty seconds in Africa, a minute passes As usual, no body is reading the article. 

> A whopping 41 per cent of the Delhi and NCR population are found to be suffering from severe heavy metal toxicity, according to a survey conducted by Daivam Wellness. **Out of 165 patients, 68 patients were found positive for some kind of severe metal toxicity**. The survey that was done over a period of 6 months, from May 2019 to October 2019 covering people from age group of 20 to 65 years, has now sparked off a scare.


The population of Delhi+NCR is 4.6 crores. The sample size of this survey is 165 which is **0.00035%** of the population. Should you be jailed for having a kid in Delhi? knowingly killing them? So 165 already ill patients were taken as a sample size, and based on these patients, 41% of Delhiites is extrapolated. 

The article is just sensationalized and poorly crafted clickbait journalism. In it the source of the survey isn't clearly mentioned but there is a comment from a doctor from Daivam wellness. Had to Google search to find that the survey was also conducted by them. 

So it seems Daivam Wellness Clinic got an infomercial out of it. After all, when it comes to health, hyping up the fear is what works best. The news also spreads faster. And it seems to have worked as well since the article is the most read on their site for the week.

I am in no way implying that the situation in Delhi isn't serious. Just that attention grabbing and sensationalized headlines with a dubious methodology of research will create more doubts than provide a concrete answer. The death of Delhi.

Following this, Rajesh and his associates beat up Balaji. According to Balaji, he also lost his ten sovereigns gold chain in the incident. Balaji approached the police and lodged a complaint. In response to this, Rajesh also filed a complaint against Balaji.

Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss
https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory Don't do this. You'll fuck up your health and also your exam. Don't eat sugar and drink plenty of water. Yo, you know, once you done with this, send me the results of what happened and if you had any hallucinations and all that stuff, and go see a god-damned psychologist. Avoid carbs and sugar. Plenty of caffeine and over the counter meds. Take some sleeping meds after the exam and sleep for a week. When you wake up this all will have been a dream Don't do this dude. You will suffer the consequences of this all-nighter week for a long time. You have enough IQ, you have enough discipline. Just forget that you will fail and just study as well as you can. Get enough sleep, be hydrated. 

Over-studying is not a good way to compensate for not meeting your expectations of success. Focus on being happy and helping other people in your life. Success will not make you happy if you were not happy before succeeding. 

My feeling is you don't want to study. But society and your peer-pressure has made you feel like you need to study to be successful. To hell with that brother. 

Just make sure you study enough to pass the exams. Even if you don't pass, don't fret. IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER!!

Find your true calling.  And fall in love with it. Ever heard about the Russian sleep experiment? Read it and then consider it again. Do you really want to sacrifice/jeopardize your life for some stupid exam that won't matter after a month? What's the point of giving exam if you come out to be stupid and with no knowledge of the subjects. Even I don't remember most of the things I wrote in my previous semesters. Just go and sleep, eat, study without consequences, chill watching something recreational now and then. Humans are not meant to give exams. We were meant to learn and practice and fuck. That's all. So don't stress over something that is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if you pass or fail in the exam. What matters is what you can do in your life that guides humanity to a path you desire. You don't need a piece of paper to do that. I did this for a couple of days and slept in my exam hall. Consider it'll end in only regret. Modafinil. It's available over the counter. I used that all the time in college for night outs before exams. Felt veryyyy alert. Smoked a lot of cigarettes while on it. But the crash is horrible.

Same chutiya group support the pro-Nazi groups in hating Muslims and ""halal"" food. Foreign me bhi ye hutiyapa Shuru ho gaya. Oh man..we are just f*cking bunch of parasites spreading shits wherever we go... They happily go and eat in german restaurants selling beef, they suck upto beef eating Germans..but if their own people sells beef or eat beef, then they go nutsss...! Hypocrites...! This reminds me of that Hasan Minaj bit where he compares the Indian diaspora to a biryani ""Keep the weird shit out and bring the good stuff in"" I suppose they were serving Porota Beef.
No one comes in between a Malayali and his porota beef. FFS I'm hindu and those assholes don't represent me. Just like the Taliban doesn't represent Muslims. Anyone can eat what they want. Honestly I would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off Objection on beef in Germany? Motherfuckers, this is the land of beef and pork. Fuckers, go back to India. Why the fuck are you even in Germany? Go back inside Modi's arse and eat dhokla. Objecting beef in Germany? Lol, these guys are unbelievable. If you can't tolerate people with different eating habits, maybe you shouldn't be living in places where people have different eating habits than you. Just stay home back in India if you're so close minded. This is is stupid , if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef , why restricting others bc puri duniya k samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe. How much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid, human history and HUMANITY. Keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn't have jurisdiction in Germany Well the Malayalis should have boycotted the event. Fuck these RW nuts. Why such compulsion?? If you don’t like beef don’t eat it! Let others enjoy! 😑 Aise log India ko har jagah badnaam krte hai. Germany jaakr bhi berozgaar ho to isse acha vapis aa jao. These assholes can't leave people in peace anywhere in god damn world. Don't go and settle in beef eating countries. Oh that would be India, the country you left in the first place. Now sanghi pigs have started spreading their cancer abroad. Idiots protesting other idiots.

Its an ""Indian"" food fest. Not a ""Hindu"" food fest.  25% of Indians have no prohibition against beef and do eat beef.

What moronic times we live in. Just so you guys know it's part of Hindu Culture to eat beef. Sad day - CGI Germany bowed down to goons Maybe they should come right back. Bitches These extremists don't decide what is Indian culture.  There are several states where beef is eaten.

""Kerala, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and West Bengal are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter.""

Indian culture isn't based on what a majority does either. If that is the case then lynchings would also have to be considered as an Indian culture. 

In the case of beef Some Indians eat it some don't. So if you are a part of India you can't say that your country doesn't eat beef. If you want to say that then you aren't talking about India anymore.

It isn't against Indian culture to eat beef.

It isn't against Hinduism to eat beef either. Because there are many texts that show that beef was consumed by hindus for years. The most these extremists can say it is that their political parties and groups don't eat beef, ie bjp,rss,etc. Go mallus!✨😂 > However, some right-wing Hindu organisations raised objections over the menu, saying that serving beef was a ""direct attack on Indian culture"" and **threatened to create a ruckus during the festival.**

Clear case of CGI Frankfurt getting bogged down by what can be called terrorists or atleast mafia Do these north Indians never visit a German resturant, or drive out Germans from other food fairs where I'm pretty sure some beef would be common?. Oh no. There they must integrate and be diverse. Yeah just when we have ou diverse culture on display, they want it shudh shakahari. Not in a non nazi regime my aryans. What are these idiots doing outside the country then?? Fuckers... Come back to your UP style Yogi-rajya if you want to follow your version of shuddh indian culture.

Fucktards. From what I know of cultural/food festivals, foreign embassies ask their expatriates to present the culture of their home country in the form of food, movies, books, drama, souvenirs to the natives. It is a way for the natives(Germans in this case), to experience the culture of other countries(India). 

Sanghis objected to Kerala stall serving beef as though Kerala culture cannot be presented to the Germans as Indian food. 

You can be sure that Sanghis would have also exercised control through their thug organisations to decide what movies and books would have been presented to the Germans.

It is important to understand this larger fight of control over what defines India, rather than look at this as just another instance of Sanghis preventing Keralites consuming beef. The event was called ""Indian Vegetarian Food Fest"". Here is the coverage from German national broadcaster: https://m.dw.com/hi/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95/g-50275074

 Indian embassy organized that in remembrance of 150 years of Gandhi.

I don't understand why this protest when the event was openly called vegetarian food festival. Here's the reason why malayalis/Keralites whatever u prefer are protesting.  Ig as a Malayali I can speak for

FACTS :- 1)  NRI's in Germany are mostly Malayali's like most of the NRI's in Singapore are from Tamil Nadu and Punjabi's in Canada.

 2) Hindu/Christian/Muslim/Areligious  Malayali's eat beef in general in Kerala since it's one of the only States where beef (cow meat)  is legal. 

REASON :-  Quite simple they feel their preferences are being ignored coz Christian's eat all poultry meats, Hindu's don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat pork. You see where I am getting at? You can't satisfy everyone so it leads to conflict.

Food,Have worked in marketing in food and other verticals. AMAA,27,dsy3yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsy3yu/have_worked_in_marketing_in_food_and_other/,21,"Hi everyone, love r/india. Have been some what of an active user, using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have worked in the marketing side of the food biz (think of a global fast food giant in India), so have some understanding of the processes and how the ecosystem works for the prominent food delivery partners such as Tomato and Twiggy. Moober as well. 

I have for the most part worked in digital marketing/advertising (mostly consumer facing brands) and if you have questions related to marketing or digital marketing, like why do the ads follow me, or why some Indian brands behave or react in a certain way. 

Also I will try to address questions to the best of my ability, won't be comfortable to discuss the exact brand names or my identity, apart from plausible hints! :)",truth_about_brands," What kind of sketchy personal data from Users phone do these apps capture in order to do targeted marketing?

How did you feel when you working in forces of crony capitalism? Did you have any guilt, that what you were doing is incorrect?

What happens now, post incidences like Tomato's video going viral. How do the crony capitalists' try to damage control? Does the baniya in Goyal Sahaab, ever rise up? Ye bhaiya kidhar gaye? Hello. A few questions from me.

1.	What is the behind the scenes of the food delivery companies. Also how much profit do they earn compared to the restaurants?
2.	How bad is targeted ads in India currently and how easy is it to obtain our data in the market?
3.	Also is our data shared around with other corporates too, once it has been used by the older corporate?
4.	Have you seen Mad Men? If yes, what’s your opinion on that show? 
From your experience so far,

What can I do different in starting a  kitchen? How much snooping do the apps do , since whenever i discuss about food , the notification pops up for lunch Dinner almost immediately?? 1. Why does restaurants on such food delivery apps charge high packing and other charges does it have to do something with the commission of such food delivery app ?

2. Food delivery apps collects 25rs etc as delivery fee but they never give me any bill with GST breakup for that service. (I do get restaurant's food bill) I am specifically asking about food delivery service tax invoice from Swiggy showing their GSTN and tax breakup on 25rs.

3. What's the opportunity and pay for a photographer for such 'Food photography' assignments in food delivery company ? What is done of left over excess food at night? Why do people in India obsess about the term 'Verticals'. I worked in US/Canada and never heard this from anyone, including regular Joe employees and the middle/upper Management."

The packed junkfood is far better and hygienic than the unpacked food or meals they prepare at most of the canteens nation wide. Does subway, macd, dominos, etc. count as junk food? If not, they are just exchanging one set of junk for another. With a new school coming round the corner every year, I'm afraid where would I eat now. 

We had our college and two schools, along with three cigarette and pan shop all on the same  500m long road. Talk bout bans. Remember when court banned booze sales near highways? Hotels changed their ""official entry gate"" and kept selling it

TLDR - im just sad im feeling ashamed to tell my family and friends im gonna have to shut one of the outlets needed a place to vent :(",Bluebaleno," a friend of mine who is running a kitchen only outlet also is suffering major loss these days. no orders if no coupons are running. he actually is now experimenting with starting new premium (sounding) brands with much higher pricing and than offering good discounts on the pricing. same kitchen. same food. [removed] Why is that happening? To those of you asking I run a 2 subway stores and another south indian outlet I had to shut one of the subs the other one is barely making profit but that's a good sign with how things are right now Sorry to hear that. Don't feel ashamed about anything. It's natural to feel despondent when you have to shut down your business.

  


All this up and down is part of life. Take your time. And bounce back harder. Good luck 👍 What do you mean by swiggy zomato problems? Is it that people are spending less on all this? Sad to hear this. Small business owners such as you form the backbone of our economy. Hope you come back from this stronger.

I'm no one to tell you what you tell your friends and family, but often I've found, there's simply no substitute for plain and simple truth. Businesses fail, no need to take it personally. They are close to you, they'd understand.

Best wishes for your future venture. [Check out this thread for similar discussion from another restaurant owner such as you](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/d43na8/alternate_investment_avenues_any_success_stories/f0807p9/) Feeling sad for you. 

Also disappointed by the fact that food-outlet owners in India shows no innovation in creating menu . 

I am still not sure if this idea will bring any change in your work.

&#x200B;

Agree the impact of swiggy on businesses Nope don't do that. Zomato and swigy are just loaded kids. If you need inspiration read Sam Walton's Made in America. How this guy beat Kmart who was giant at his time with his basic principal.

Become customer oriented, don't add sell spoiled paneer and keep the hygiene  up people will come by. Didn't know the slow down has such direct affects, but I think Zomato and Swiggy have a lot to do with this. There are a few Udupi restaurants near my place and the only customers they get now are the loyal customers. The owner of one of the restaurant I frequent told me that he knows most of his customers by face / name and his home delivery service is almost never called because of Swiggy/Zomato.

Since he operates on thin margins, adapting Swiggy and Zomato would mean making losses which he doesn't want to do. A lot of people that stumble upon these place do definitely become repeat customers just because of the friendliness of the owner, the hygiene and taste. But a lot of people aren't coming out of houses because food delivery service is cheap and more convenient.

Another proper dine-in restaurant near my house started pushing own coupons. So, everytime you order from Swiggy, they put a leaflet in the packaging that requests the customer to order directly and get similar discounts. This way, he's eliminating the need to pay Swiggy. I think his discounts aren't absolute discounts but free stuff or coupons that you can redeem in the next order. Not sure how it's working out for him, though. Apart from my first comment which gives a idea on how to survive I am just venting out as a customer.

The reason people are going for zomato or swiggy is because they have people who listen to the customer in case of issue. In the case of local vendor if you bring back the packed food and say its spoiled. The shop owner show his big glare to the customer and make sure to remind that he is a outsider in a city and the shop owner is the local don.

People do not want cash back every time they complain. They complain because they think you guys could fix that from next time. As I see the restaurants or streets they would be locked down if the FDI officer do their job properly.

So, to all the ass\* ho are crying over the down economy and serving the same three days old ""samosa"" after re-frying to customer. Your competition is not with Swiggy or Zommator your competition is to the millions of the home maker (mothers and sister) who can make a nice and fresh meal in budget then you. This is kind of unrelated, but what are your profit margins? Instead of being quieter talk more about it. Right now country is not even realising we are in recession. Best of luck bro. Failure in entrepreneurship is nothing to be ashamed of. Learn lessons and move on. Out of the loop here; how is Zomato and Swiggy fucking things? 

Had heard bad stuff about Zomato gold from some restaurants but didn’t know kitchen only restaurants are also being hit. What food do you guys sell ? Sucks to hear. Hope your situation improves soon. 

Having said that, restaurants that are able to compete in these difficult times are probably amongst the best ones in terms of customer satisfaction. Maybe you can look into why some are managing to survive the circumstances better than you. Millenials are just eating at home now Curious, you are making Rs 3 lakhs a month, how much do the Zomato/Swiggy eat into your profit share? From 36000 a week to 10000 a day the business must be doing good right ? sorry to hear it bro. 

What kind of food did you sell? I hope shutting down this outlet will at least save you from losing more money! What are these ""Zomato Problems""? I have seen a lot of restaurants with this. What is the issue? Hey, staying in context is there a body that decides what restaurants should price their food at? Like have a cap to max pricing and if I price a dish at 300bucks does it justify me selling it at that price ?. I am a millennial,  i avoid restaurants, food outlets like a plague. I prefer homemade food over any restaurant or food outlets. I’d eat restaurant food in rare cases, like hanging out with friends with unhealthy food habits.

Why? 


1. Who the fuck know how you folks prepare the food. Do we even have hygienic conditions certified, well, im sure it can be bought with some bribing.

2. What kind of sub- standard ingredients you might have used to reduce the price or increase your margins.

3. And for those zomato and swiggy, where do u get the food from? From some ghost kitchens with no hygienic certifications or restaurants which send in left over food or delivery boys mishandling and tasting the food before delivering to me. 

I hope all my millennial fellows boycott these restaurants, outlets like KFC, McDonalds and prefer home made fresh and hygienic food over these discounted swiggy or overpriced pubs.


I rather spend my money on fresh handpicked vegetables and groceries than your ‘quality home delivered food’"
Food,"People with severe chronic gastritis, how do you manage with the spicy Indian masala-laden food?",14,dsxwgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsxwgu/people_with_severe_chronic_gastritis_how_do_you/,18,"Title ^

I am on pantoprazole 40 everyday from the past 5 years. The day i stop it, it fucks me up. How do you manage to not eat food without spices and on the way not provoking the already bad ulcers in your tummy? Literally everything has spices. Even the dosas and idlies are acidic because they are fermented. Even if you ignore them, you cannot just eat them and need something to go with them. 

Any help is appreciated. 

Thanks.",NormalAdvertising," Go and see a doctor, it seems you have chronic acid reflux. Just identify trigger foods and start eliminating them. Diary, gluten, high fat, acidic foods all could create issue. 

Also there is something called rebound reflux. If you want to get out of medicines you shouldn't stop cold turkey. It has to happen over a period of a month or two specially when you have been taking PPIs for 5 years.

Get tested for Hpylori and go through the 3-course antibiotics if you are positive. Check for vitamin B12 deficiency since PPIs also cause decrease in nutrient absorption

Personally, I've been facing this and GERd since 2014. I've been able to get out of PPIs only through diet. I make my own food devoid of all trigger foods and that includes spices, high fat, oily, acidic stuff, diary and gluten. Yes, I don't eat dosas, idlis etc. However, i still have to take PPIs/H2 blockers from time to time

gerd an and gastritis subreddits are helpful. Feel free to PM me I too was on a ton of PPIs until I saw a gastroenterologist who suggested I give up dairy. Turns out, I was lactose intolerant, and my acid reflux wasn't a result of spicy foods. I was actually eating extra dairy to ""calm"" my stomach from the spicy foods, but that was literally the worst thing for me to be eating.

I'm not suggesting you are lactose intolerant, but it's worth speaking to a knowledgable gastroenterologist. Try including yoghurt in your diet. Drink raw cabbage juice 2, 3 times a day on empty stomach. 
Wheatgrass powder also helps. Also try avoiding gluten and dairy. While PPI's are generally safe and effective in treating gastritis, long term usage can be linked to nutritional deficiencies. Diet & lifestyle modification coupled with maintenance medication will enable you to get your health sorted. Check with a licensed dietician/nutritionist on how to properly go about that taking into account your dietary preferences.

Did you go to a gastroenterologist? I noticed that you said you went to a doctor but I find it concerning you were just put on pantop w.o addresing the possibility of h.pylori infection or immune system woes.

Also, a slight misconception is that spices make acidity worse. While it is true that spicy food will irritate stomach lining and aggravate ulcers, the real culprits are fats, oils & carbs leading to reflux & bloating. PPIs are also bad for the kidneys on long term usage. Have you got endoscopy done? What was the final diagonosis of your illness? Did you test for H-Pylori? Eat a lot of yogurt. I got collitis(infectious) when I was visiting India with my parents and it was a shit show. I started eating yogurt every day and my pain went away after a few weeks. I still make sure to eat yogurt 4-5 times a week and it has drastically improved my condition. That being said my collitis was caused due to an infection and inqs prescribed antibiotics for it."

Lets all say Wah MudiJi Wah! Modi hai to mumkin hai.. FCI hasn't been getting their money from the government for more than a decade now, [it was the same even before Modi and with the Congress government](https://images.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2019-01%2F615dbb12-e935-437a-af9d-c4a9f48f197b%2FOFF_BUDGET_FINANCING_OF_FOOD_SUBSIDY_01.png?w=960&auto=format%2Ccompress). FCI borrowed loans from banks and the government paid those loans! So what has changed? 

* National Food Security Act, 2013 which increased the coverage
* ""Buy High, Sell Low"" philosophy of FCI which leads to Higher supply of wheat and rice stocks than demand
* Due to high supply, the stock is either wasted or private players rent it out for which FCI plays rental costs

So what does the FCI do when government no longer pays and banks can no longer disburse loans? The government lends it money via   - National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) [67% of their funds](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/food-corporations-reliance-on-national-small-savings-fund-rose-further-in-fy19) come from them. 


[CAG audit had warned about this in 2017](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/stK4MriiNoMkJSGgJYfSDP/CAG-flags-loopholes-in-food-subsidy-scheme.html) but the current government has taken no steps to address the situation. How does the govt. mess up in basic economic policies which even a 12th grade commerce student would know how to implement. I have a doubt. From where does the govt procure wheat and rice for the ""Food Security Bill"" which in a way affects the PDS system ? Is it in anyway related to the Food corporation of india? Debt doesnt die, it just changes hand, someone will be holding all this shit when the music stops, and when it does, be it LIC or NSSF it will be in a a shitstorm. God help us all.

Food,"Zomato delivery boys go on strike in Mumbai, Bengaluru after food app cuts incentives.",241,d69iwf,https://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/zomato-delivery-boys-executives-strike-in-mumbai-bengaluru-after-food-app-cuts-incentives/story/379576.html,60,,aiyyooooo," Just proves that reckless cash burn ends up hurting the employees the most. it was bound to happen. Same happened with ola uber drivers who were earning like 1 lakh plus+ when incentives were high. Did the delivery boys really expect that the salary model was sustainable ? some were earning around 40-45k per month or even more than that. Its basic economics catch the market using freebies and incentives , later on shoot up prices. Same happened with ola, uber. Next are these food delivery services, after that jio will also show its true colours. 'gig' economy These food delivery companies will die soon in losses won't they Deepinder Goyal must be losing it. Robots can scan unlimited menus, but menus and hotels are limited. first of all Zomato workers should understand that there is s economic slowdown. moreover the food prices  shown in Zomato are more than the actual price at hotel.  people are ready to pay more but consumers slowly realising that the food is not as per their expectations such as quantity and quality. Even I am avoiding Zomato. People are saying India is the perfect opportunity for startups but it seems like the economy is bad enough for the so called ""startup culture"" to survive. ""Fine I'll do it myself"" is my reaction after finding out the field is mine to play. Here in Berlin, till this years start we had 3 food delivery companies. 

Foodora, deliveroo, and liferando. 

2 of them have shut shop and only 1 remains in the market right now, even their delivery times are upwards of 1 hour. 

I don’t think its a very profitable business. This is where the sustainability of this model comes into picture. You'll get offers until they have investor money to burn. What do they do after that?

I believe that Zomatos, Swiggys and foodpandas (don't know about the rest) revenue models are unsustainable. Enjoy the deals while it lasts/while investors pump in $$$.

My thinking is this - a restaurant hiring someone - the employee cost will be a part of their overheads, which is subsumed by overall revenue earned by the restaurant.

Whereas, Z's or Sw's revenue is say 25% of a particular delivery only order, therefore the employee cost being absorbed by a limited revenue stream will be significantly lesser, unless the delivery guys make at least four trips a day. It may take them many many more years to break even.

Also, when I order from them, I get huuuge discounts which are not necessarily cash backs. Offsetting that maybe more costly than the benefit itself.

They are looking at expanding and creating a greater market base (like all app based companies do and should) but its close to saturation. I'm sure these guys are looking at alternate revenue streams. I am not entirely sure how these delivery boys feel entitled to ask for incentives and bonuses.

I work in IT, I get bonus ONLY if my company did well the past year, if I kissed my boss' ass enough, sacrificed a virgin to the mighty gods AND made it rain 4 days in a row. If not, I get nothing.

I don't go and stage a protest against my company."

Gaya kutta. The guy said he sent it to his village and he's absconding. WTF There is no repentance for this.Good boi thief😡 Holy fuck! That woman is so unbearable so full of herself!!!

Even though Zomato responded to her via DM immediately, she tweeted calling for uninstalling Zomato until they return her 'Dottu' back to her and retweeted someone else who said that he has requested all his family members to not order from Zomato. She even tagged PMOIndia for this!

Apart from that in her Twitter feed she is seen posing with her book with all the celebrities whom she for a picture to be taken with - Rafael Nadal, Jeffery Archer, Arun Jaitley. And her twitter handle name is Vandy**4PM**! Narcissist no. 1 she is!!!

FYI, the delivery guy did not take the dog when he was delivering food. Apparently the dog was loitering *outside* their house near an eatery where Zomato delivery guys come for order pickups. That is where and when the dog was picked up. It could have been literally picked up by anyone else too. >roaming inside the premises of her home cum-factory complex

Clean and Clear Face wash #i fucking love dosa So I got up at 7 and somehow gathered the courage to go for school at this cold. I reached by 7:50 and the moment I enter the class it’s dark, it’s entirely empty and cold. Like a horror movie. 5 minutes are left and there are only 3 bags out of the 63 chairs. I felt a little shook up and and got out to see the entire 10th section is out and only 9th graders are there. I went to a group of hostlers gathered who were my friends and on greeting them they say “abey kyun aagye ?” And when I replied they said”abey jao aaj koi nahi aaya hai” and I said “3 bag hai to” and he said “khali hum teen hostlers hain aur hum log bhi Abhi Sir se puuch ke waapis boarding chale jayenge akele rahoge tum” “jao, JAO BE JALDI” and that heard I started leaving the bell rang I ran out through the back gate and fucked off

TLDR: Went to school and the classroom was empty and ran out before I would fuck up my day being a loner Shitposting is the language of the RDTs. It's the only known language that the RDT can communicate with. If you dont like shitposting its most likely due to Bunty.

😶 Paneer Manchurian banaunga aaj, bus hagg na du. Jyada chinese ho jaayega hagg diya toh So, I’ve had sleep issues ever since 7th grade. Can only sleep for a maximum of 4 hours at night. And those 4 hours are very disturbed. I keep waking up, despite my house being very quiet in the mornings (the whole fam wakes up at 10 XD). Anyways, on a normal day especially if I sleep for less than 3 hours, my energy is on a whole new level. I feel so productive, and I can feel the energy and enthusiasm in my veins. Not even kidding. This is happening right now. I slept for 3 hours last night, and I feel like doing cartwheels in the middle of the road. 

But on a rare night of disturbed sleep of 6-8 hours, my energy gets subdued. More like normal.

Basically what I wanna ask is... CHALO PARTY KARTE HAIN. KISIKA SAR PHODE YA KHANA KHAYE? WHO WANTS TO DANCE? WHO WANTS TO SING? LET’S GOOOOOOOOO!!’n That moment when you're old and tharki. Why did I do this to myself, shouldn't have showed up to my farewell party. Everyone is looking like 10x better than me and I can't find my friends but my girl crush is looking bomb so I guess it's worth it.

It is important to drink water especially because it makes you pee more. Think about it, when you pee, your body is ridding itself of waste materials of all sorts. If you don't drink water because you don't want to pee.

 like Doctor Bunty says,*your body won't get rid of those materials and they tend to build up somewhere, and usually that means kidney stones, and they're not fun at all to deal with.*



My advice: 

Don't skip a glass of water because you don't want to pee. Drink water because it makes you pee and you'll be healthier as a result. Your urethra will thank you in years to come when it doesn't have to pee out stones the size of small marbles. ouch!

""A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a babbling stream. It's too treacherous to cross, so the scorpion nicely asks the frog to carry him across on its back. This makes the frog a little suspicious. It asks, “How do I know you won’t sting me?” The scorpion says, “Because if I do, I will die too.” That sound reasoning relaxes the frog's nerves. 

So he allows the scorpion to climb aboard and they shove off across the flowing water. They get halfway across the stream and the scorpion stings the frog directly in the middle of his back. The frog feels the onset of the scorpion's poison and starts to sink. He manages one dying breath: ""Why?!"" And the scorpion replies: “It’s my nature.” How much does ineffective communication hinder productivity at the typical Indian workplace?

I have noticed on multiple occasions mundane tasks taking long to get done just because a person in the organisation is adamant about how they want to communicate something to someone else. And they don't mind getting someone to repeat the task ensuring it's done the way they've planned it.

Food,Food unites. Location: Berlin,362,d17kn0,https://i.redd.it/k462jctgfbl31.jpg,56,,Bon_Koios," I think it's mostly Pakistani food, they just add India to it to sell more as Indian food is more people know about Indian food. In the US too, most Pakistani restaurants say 'Pakistani Indian' in order to sell more. Not many people know about Pakistani food I guess. Its a Pakistani restaurant. No Indian restaurant owner advertises as Pakistani-Indian food, only the Pakistani ones do. Not that I have a problem with that, just stating some facts Thats the description of almost every Pakistani restaurant in the west. The thing is Indian and Pakistani food is mostly similar but Indian food is more known and to attract more people they mention Indian in the description. Even Bangladeshi restaurants call it a Indian-Bangladeshi restaurant. Thats how you can identify if it is an Indian or a Pakistani owned restaurant, not that I care but there is a slight difference in the tastes Owner of a restaurant in Singapore serving Indian food told he was from Punjab. Well he was not incorrect...just a matter of which Punjab! Almost every ""Indian"" restaurant in New York is actually owned by Bangladeshis. Indian and Pakistani food are craved for the same bartan. The food is very similar as per the North Indian food and the food from Pakistan. Animosity has made this division that India and Pakistan are of two very different countries they are not. We wear similar clothes and we have a common language. YOU'RE AT LOLLAPALOOZA? GO TO PERRY STAGE TONIGHT most 'Indian' restaurants are usually run by pakistanis/bangladeshis in europe this might be because of that. How would they like random street food festivals with interchangeable German-Austrian food? awesome, we just had a similar event here in Oslo. Love Indian food Holi Cow :O Inb4 German gaurakshaks threaten the event.

On another note, the reason they include ""Indian"" in their name because food is quite similar in both countries and most people have heard of Indian food. In addition to it, since India is a huge cultural exporter (Bollywood, yoga etc), it makes sense to be grouped in the predominant culture due to each others' similarities. But trust me, most Indians or Pakistanis don't care about the nationality of restaurant owners. People get along quite well. One famous restaurant that comes to my mind is Zareen's in Palo Alto/Mountain View. Actually, having been to Berlijn, the chances are that the person preparing and selling the food isn't actually from any of the 3 prominent South Asian nations of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.

For example, a lot of kitchens in Croatia serve Turkish food (but there aren't any Turks in-house) and many of the pizza outlets in Germany have Romanians (rather than Neapolitans) working in the kitchen.

When I was in middle school class 5th to be accurate, there was a girl X in my class. X spread rumors that I have proposed her for god knows why. As usual these types of rumors spread pretty quickly. A teacher came to know about it. It was a school in a small town and beating was considered a legitimate form of punishment back then. So this teacher beats the shit out of me in front of whole class. After that whole class used to treat me like shit. It was so horrible that I used to cry daily in my bed knowing that I will have to face same bullying tomorrow in school. 
I changed school next year and bullying stopped but I never talked to girls after that, anxiety comes up if I try to do so. In college I try to talk only if it becomes extremely necessary. 

Now coming to interesting part. That bitch X sent me a friend request on FB today. #Here's the follow up to Tay tha:

Hi /u/zealous_gal I had a showerthought to share. Bhool gaya. FML. My mom spend over a lakh to tour Andaman in October and forcefully took me. She spends a thousand RS every 2 weeks in visits with her friends. 

I wished to go to science city again for  some time because I love that place. Mom heard and wanted to go. I said no so she asked slyly if I'm taking someone else. She literally forced me and the total bill yesterday for 2 was rs 1060. And she literally started complaining of body ache one hour in and didn't let me complete my own trip I planned for so long.


Now today she's complaining how she spent rs 1060 on me for a trip she didn't like when I repeatedly told her not to go. 


What did I do wrong here? My friend in tenth gestures his then gf to go out of the library , in the make out zone of the school , and make out. His gf agrees. They go out and come back in the next class.

This level of game , I mean. Wow. 4 years later, this is what I have done till now

I ask my female friend to come with me , on my activa, to go to the cafe we friends were going to. She ignored me ( not even making it look like ignoring ) and books a cab. 

Life is good. Attended the wedding. Bride and groom were looking fab!
Food was okay, nothing special. Place and decor was excellent.

Wife checked out and showed me 2 women and asked sexy hai na.. I replied not as sexy as you. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I'll be screwed if either of the following users deactivate their accounts in the next few days now that my mom is away and I crave caring female company and reassuring/comforting words and funny dialogues.

Make sure you use your earphones/headphones. Thanks a lot ! :) [deleted] Alright people, I am conflicted. Please give me your kind suggestions.

I finally got a job in a startup in a 'Graphic Designer' role. It's a food and beverage industry and they operate a modern, neo, fancy tea stall in a busy and old part of the city. They're also planning to open a delivery and take away-only outlet in the location where the parent company is located (and where I attended the interview).

The CEO himself came and interviewed me. Guy seemed pretty charismatic, commanding yet, understanding too. He was the same age group as I am in, probably not older than 32 I'd wager. And I had a good time being interviewed by him.

He didn't ask for any original documents to be surrendered either. No bond was mentioned during this interview too. He insisted on me telling my salary expectation when I tried to tell him that I am okay with what the company usually offers, to a fresher like myself. And I told him not less than 10k for which, he agreed.

Everything seemed fine and I was interested to join (finally my 3 months of Job hunting comes to an end, I guess). But, when I asked him about the weekends, that's where I got a bit reluctant in joining. 

He told me that not only Saturday but Sunday too, will be working as well, it's a food and beverage industry it seems. Understandable I guess, except I'm at a loss. It makes sense for chefs and people behind the kitchen to work all 7 days as well, food is something that's always in demand but, even a designer like myself too?

Can anyone please help and tell me if there is a valid reason for me to show up all 7 days, as a designer? The timing however, wasn't long and was reasonable (from 10 am to 6/6:30pm). He even told me that I could leave early if I'm done with my work and that long working hours is usually rare and happens when meeting certain project deadlines.

Also, asked about the dress code and he told me they will provide a set of 3 shirts (not sure if polo or botton-down shirts) with which I could wear any trousers. This might seem like me whining and a minor complaint but I hate tucking my shirt in (unless if I wear a suit or a waistcoat) and I'm a firm believer of ""Clothes make the man"" as I would feel quite uncomfortable if that's the case (He didn't mention anything about it though and he himself was in a semi-formal untucked attire, so ya).

He told me that he'll give me the offer/call letter once I visit Wednesday. Maybe it would be specific as to what designation that I will be serving there as exactly? And might include all the details, the do's and don'ts ? My exact salary package (we had an agreement that it shouldn't be less than 10k but who knows it might be more than that sum)?

Anyways people, shall I start working here (date of joining is this Wednesday) or shall I decline and look for another job as, 7 days working schedule is a bit much? Or shall I give it a shot and quit, if it proves to be too much for me?

TL;DR - Landed in a food and beverage company as a graphic designer. Satisfied with how the interview went but all 7 days will be working it seems albeit fairly flexible timing. Accepting or declining this job is my dilemma now. Head feels like a pressure cooker about to burst. I know crying will help but haven't been able to cry. Any ideas?

StayStrongFam How many peeps actually believe that India would be a super power, God knows when but at least there is a little hope or not? I've always loved this quote from Neil Gaiman in *The Kindly Ones*:
> “Have you ever been in love? Horrible, isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses. You build up this whole armor, for years, so nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life… You give them a piece of you. They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like ""maybe we should just be friends"" or ""how very perceptive"" turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. Nothing should be able to do that. Especially not love. I hate love.” Guys who've lived with parents all their life, do you feel left out when friends staying in hostel/pg have so many stories to tell? Like they have so many adventures when they do normal shit like going out for dinner kyuki cook nahi aya or going out for a ride..

And you have the same old story.. Ghar gaya, mummy ne khana de dia, so gaya.. My life seems pointless, It's becoming more painful. Left job, and now I'm not able to study, feeling lonely trying to talk to people online but at the end realising that no one give shit, they all are there short term pleasure, I don't know why I'm seeking validation, just watched bojack and now I want  someone to say me that it's not over to change the life just like he was asking to dian...fuck my whole existence is painfull and I want to end it.

> A seemingly innocuous advertisement of the beverage, released in September 2018, was retrieved from the archives of the world wide web to give parent company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) a hard time.

> The ad shows a Hindu man approaching a Ganpati idol-maker to take home a murti of Bappa for the first time. The elderly idol-maker offers parcels of knowledge about Hindu traditions and tales to his customer, leaving the man suitably impressed. But then, because it’s time for his namaaz, the idol-maker puts on a skull cap, revealing his Muslim identity. The Hindu buyer is surprised, feels betrayed and disappointed.

> *“I have some work today, I’ll come back tomorrow,”* he says, excusing himself from the interaction.

> The idol-maker asks him to at least stay for (Red Label) tea. Facilitated by a glass of chai, the Hindu man’s bigotry disappears when the Muslim man explains why he does what he does: *“Bhaijaan, yeh bhi toh ibadat hai”* (Brother, this is also worship).

> The last frame reads, *""Inspired by a true story.""* Boycott culture has officially entered India, but unfortunately, it won't work because most companies in India are monopolies, even the so called bhakts would find it difficult to find alternatives to these everyday things. Perhaps that is why Patanjali is present, but even then, it is sub par and so the Bhakts will silently revert to the quality products they used previously. I searched for the Red Label ad on YouTube and this was the first search result - https://youtu.be/l99pVT8MOXQ

I am speechless 😶. Bhakti is really blind. No one actually follows this in real life outside of twitter.

People think twitter represents India and thats just so false. Why do people think that twitter is real India? People wanted to boycott surf excel but nothing happened. People wanted to boycott Zomato but nothing happened.

We Indians just suck at protests and boycotting. Extremists (Of every religion) are trash. And its sad to see that in this day and age, they have the louder voice in our country. I don't even know where our country is going anymore. 
""Secular"" is only used in political propaganda and the true meaning of it is already being forgotten. Why are religious people even allowed to sue others with the reason of 'X's words hurt my faith' thats stupid because as an atheist their words hurt my ideology when they force me to pray but can I sue them? No.
Despite having freedom of religion, we still are not free. [deleted] [deleted] I don’t give a shit about religion but don’t you think showing hindus always as intolerant and showing muslims as good hearted kinda defeats the purpose of these videos?.

Name and shame. Nestle is the most evil corporation ever. Whenever there is a thread on askreddit about evil companies Nestle is always on the top Sick I dont know why im surprised, fuck nestle How come no government is able to reign in nestle effectively? Maybe it’s too powerful as a company Nestle is a kind of a serial offender of a company. How the fuck do these fucking companies have the gall to do such shady stuff in India and not in US? First Johnson and Johnson and now Nestle. > Breaking the law, Nestle has conducted clinical trials on 75 premature babies in five hospitals on substitutes for breast milk in complete contravention of the Infant Milk Substitutes Act. It was found by Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) on screening the trial registry of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that Nestle has sponsored a research titled “Multicentric Observational Study to Observe Growth in Preterm hospitalised infants”.

> The trial was conducted on 75 premature babies between the age of 28-34 weeks. The objective of the study was to assess the growth and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. One of the exclusions was that the infant could not be fed milk substitute within 48 hours of birth, but from the third day onwards, the trial suggested that the infant could be given a milk substitute instead of breast milk.

Cthulu and I will stay here and work out the details. These are the companies we need to boycott. Not Zomato or Snapdeal Boycott Nestle Hope they get fined to oblivion Cross post this to /r/hydrohomies 

They loathe Nestle and can possibly make this news viral. Why is Nestle suddenly violating laws in India? Is it looking to join BJP? Ok I guess some proper information needs to be given here. I am a medical Prof who has done fair share of research across international papers and so I can tell abt these studies and what is the ACTUAL problem.

1. First of all, clinical trials on premature babies are done all the time. Observational studies, randomized control trials are done occasionally and hence it is not 'BARBARIC'. These trials are done precisely to know whether the treatment options that we have are even worth it or not. 

The substitute for breast milk is actually necessary especially when mother is not lactating and you need to feed breast milk to baby. The suckling reflex hasn't developed in premature baby and hence they need to be given from outside. Sometimes breast milk is just not available or is inadequate and hence a substitute is absolutely necessary.

2. Ok now comes this study. First of all, any study of such type is always done after ethical clearance AND after consent from the parents. This is true for all subjects of any study. Most probably there is a case control study here where some premat babies are fed normal breast milk and some are fed with substitute milk. And then the growth is seen. After the result the subjects are always shifted back to standard therapy .

Again consent is always taken.

3. Now we say any Nestle. The thing which Nestle did was break the law which said THEY CANT GIVE MONETARY OR OTHER BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. Nestle is a company which is creating a new product. That is fine. They have to get it tested in clinical trials. That is completely fine as well. The researchers have to do it in respective hospitals with proper place for premat babies and a NICU etc etc. That is fine as well.

However giving benefits to the researcher involved for a skewed result? That is not ok. 

Starting research before official ethical clearence certificate? That is not ok.

Basically if the wordings of this article are correct, then the problem is that Nestle is most prob hiring researchers on their own terms and hence the study isn't exactly unbiased...

4. Is it harmful to babies? It depends really. If they are shifted back to current gold standard of treatment after results and everything else is ensured ( see their exclusion criteria is pretty good). Then it won't hurt them. However is the results are skewed when they are actually not useful then it can be harmful for further babies who receive them in subsequent trials. Hence why unbiased research is really important in clinical trials.

So everyone, hold your horses. It is not as unethical as you are thinking. They are not killing babies here nor are they doing something absolutely horrible. However it does become unethical when it is forming an unbiased research. That should be condemmned. 

Research is a wonderful thing and we should do it unbiased to help everyone involved. Nowhere is any mention of penalizing the company. Is there any provision of penalty or prosecution for the company involved. Man. Nestle is fucked up
And I thought I was being healthy by eating nestle products India is/becoming the guinea pig for experiments of the western world! Do the parents know that their infant is part of such trials? Does the doctor or anyone else inform them? Ugh There real question should be , what are we going to do about it? Congress mouthpiece is doing better journalism than many so-called neutral outlets like Republic.  I'm not even suprised tho! Nestle has a reputation of going to third world countries and doing shit like this. They are honestly, EVIL! How much evil shit can be leveraged over Maggi noodles Evil scum, its hard but I try my best to stay away from their products Don't they already have premature baby food? Pure evil! I kinda thought they would learn something after starving and infecting to death babies of perfectly healthy mothers. Nope, they were just waiting for another unsuspecting people.

Wtf? Dude, this is one of the most popular dishes in Bengal. People can die for 'Bhapa ilish' here. Kali (Tamil) / Mudde (Kannada) / Sangatti, with dry fish curry or drumstick+Brinjal curry.   
    
Beef blood fry. Had this a very long ago at my home town.    
   
‘Nalli omelet’ made from mutton bone marrow and ‘kari dosai’, dosai with mutton toppings) of Madurai. Pork in bamboo shoot sounds Coorgi. Sprinkle some generous pepper on it while you’re at it mate.

I love the humble “Zunka bhakri thecha” from Maharashtra a lot - it may be relatively common within the state but I’d be surprised if folks outside of MH knew.

Some other such lesser known delights include “Dadpe Pohe” (again from MH), and Chicken Berry Pulao (Irani). Pompfret fry Chicken/Mutton/Lamb Ghee Roast in the Mangalore area (where it originated). Mamma mia! Ros Omelette and prawns balchao from Goa.

Squid Ghee Roast, neer dosa + chicken ros curry and pork baffat from Mangalore.

All of these dishes are popular in their own regions but quite unknown outside. Kokie 

Sindhis unite Momo -  Better if eaten in Sikkim.

Egg roll/Chicken roll/Beef roll - Calcutta street food

Tel Ilish - Ilish fish fried in the oil of the fish itself.

Chingri Chop - Pakoda made with mashed prawn.

Potoler Dorma - Parwal Curry

Muri Ghonto - A fish head curry

Begun Pora - Roasted Aubergine mixed with chilli, onion, mustard oil, salt, garlic

Rui Macher Kaliya - Hot curry of Rohu fish

Chaap Ruti - Fried Mutton minced meat and Rumali Roti Bheja fry? Epic channel dekh Liya kya bhai Aaj ?? Tibetan Tsampa Mutton chukka varuval. It's like a dry mutton fried with spices. It's very tasty. I recommend trying it in Anjappar if there's one in your city. Mines a Gujarati dish called “khichu” which is generally made out of rice flour. Puranpoli/holige ~ rotis stuffed with chana dal and jaggery. Paratha stuffed with minced beef Man, all of you have so much food experience. All i eat is chicken and dal rice. Saag and makki di roti. GREATEST meal of all time. Pork cooked with Mustard leaves and rajma. Pithla bhakri ani Thecha - Thecha is chopped chillies mixed with spices and other stuff. Pithla is something that is like a gelatinious dal type thingy containing besan mixed with sauteed spices. And a bhakri is a roti made of jawar or millet. Food for the soul, people. Good, good shit. Coloccasia leaf vada called patrode is absolutely amazing. Reminds me of my ex but beach kadlai. Yumm! I'm not even keralite but I love puttu and Kerala porata with some good curries. Avial... patholi - made of chana  paste Misal paav. Bhel, pani puri, Konkani fish Coconut rice with slow cooked mutton curry

Are people there aware of things happening in Hong Kong if yes what are their thoughts on the matter? OPs silence about the Hong Kong protests also speaks a lot about China.

• How are the job opportunities within China, and what is the work culture like?

• Is finding employment made more difficult by your status as a foreign national?

• What, if any, impact does living under an authoritarian state (atleast with less individual freedom than in India) have on your daily life?

Any special sayings in your family, that got you through tough times? Hey ! How is the current situation in Kashmir ?

1. Is everything normal as claimed by the govt.?
2. Are people happy now that 370 is no more ?
3. Will pandits be able to go back to Kashmir or do they want to go back ?
4. Will govt. compensate the loss that businesses are having due to snapping of internet ?

Believing media is real hard as they are biased. What is the current view of people there on Indian people/Government? [deleted] How do you feel about security forces?


How do you feel the way Pandora are portrayed? Where do the minorities of Kashmir: Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs stand on the issue of independence or merger with pakistan? What’s your favourite color? Have you read the book Our Moon Has Blood Clots?

What's your opinion on it? Do Muslims threaten to kill you, rape your women unless they're willing to convert, and burn your houses? Or is that a lie spread by low-life BJP muthafuckas? Just got news from a friend in Jammu that Jammu is having a bandh to protest against snapping of internet and loss of business.

Is Kashmir also observing a bandh ? How would you feel like if Kashmir gets developed like other states, cities aka Concrete Jungle, factories etc.? You've mentioned the views of your community, and that of other communities, but tell me your personal views. Do you personally feel the removal of 370 was the right move? What is a pandit?

AMA,AMA. I'm from Kashmir.,127,dt1ark,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dt1ark/ama_im_from_kashmir/,257,"Hi. A Kashmiri here. Kashmir for the past 91 days has been under a lockdown. And the government has no plans of giving the people any respite till deep winter.
The season's first snowfall was witnessed today and the administration refuses to clear the roads and get the electricity back on.",bropunzal," Did mods verify? Basic question - How are you and your family? How true are the claims that there has been not a single bullet fired since the announcement was made?
Is it true that no childen have been detained by the police?
Are emergency medical facilities available?
What is the situation on procuring the basic necessities like food materials?
Do you think that lifting the lockdown would result in violence? Do you have more appreciation of internet after this episode? Or has this forced digital detox, while highly inconvenient, made you appreciate offline life more- friends, relatives, physical activity, hobbies? What can be done to diminish the unrest? How have Kashmiris taken to the splitting of most of the state into Ladakh, both in terms of impact it has on Kashmiri identity and more day to day stuff like administration, jobs and economy? Just curious as to what Kashmiri locals think about genocide on Pandits, ethnic cleansing, driving them out and looting their properties. It is no secret that locals to some extent collaborated with the militants as they saw the violence beneficial. Do you agree that these murderers should be brought to justice similar to how nazi war criminals hiding were hunted down and brought to courts? What do Kashmiri’s feel about the lockdown? Why is gustaba served last? I read your another comment, and want to follow up on it. You'll understand the political sensitivity of the issue, but what can Indian state do over time to make things better. Asking as this has to improve, Indian state is investing so much money, lives are being lost, and no one is happy with anything. Would you and other Kashmiris like Kashmir to be like other Indian states? By other Indian states I mean no lockdown but also no special status. Hi, Kashmiri here (not in Kashmir). I don't have any questions to ask, just wanted to say that I hope that you are your family are doing well. I see stuff on the news channels and I'm worried for my relatives there :( Firstly, thank you for doing this. I have a couple acquaintances in the valley but haven't been able to muster the courage to text them. No words can comfort them. I hope things get better soon.

I am curious about the healthcare situation there?Earlier there were reports of life saving medicenes and critcal care equipment shortage. Is it any better now? 

Also, how heavily is the military deployed there? As in are they at every street corner, every block? Have they cut off neighborhoods from each other? What are your day to day interactions with them like? Are they hostile towards the locals or indifferent? [deleted] Salam.. Don't want to ask you anything. Just want to say sorry. As an Indian and as a human being.

I can't even begin to imagine what it must've been like for you guys for the last three months. I still, to this day, have not been able to contact my friends who live in an area called Bren Nishaat, if I recall correctly, in Srinagar. Not even a simple text exchange to ask how they and their families are.. And that alone is a huge indicator of just how badly wrong things have gone. 

May Allah keep you safe and happy. As a Kashmiri, what is your personal preference? Would you like Kashmir to be with India, Pakistan, or stay independent ?
Edit: can you also share your religion for context?
Edit 2: What do other Kashmiri feel about this? Dapaan neth karen restore yakum decembar peth? beyi mah trayan rail ti yalle. Halaat che laegmet thoda  calm down gasni magar  meh basaan yi phaeri wapsi cxouri nai weryeh. Tohih kya basaan? What do Kashmiris want? Except for the removal of restrictions which I believe should happen asap and except reinstating 370 and 35a which the current government won't do? I don't want to get political but how as the sentiment changed towards the nation after the episode, you can ignore the question if you want. Just trying to understand what this has done in the minds of the people apart from the obvious. I personally think Kashmir should be made a independent entity with only foreign relations and defence being managed by the central government. This is to counter the threats from Pakistan and China. This would also mean Kashmiri's only enjoy the same privileges in rest of India that rest of India has in Kashmir. Do you think that'd be a better outcome for Kashmir? 

TBH I haven't seen a good argument for keeping article 370. Yes it ended special privileges that Kashmiri's enjoyed but the article itself has been so diluted it was hardly doing much. Apart from an emotional reasoning what is it that Kashmiri's oppose in removal of art 370. Assuming the lockdown didn't happen, cause that is terrible. What are your thoughts on Jammu and it's people? I see people/media mentioning about Kashmir a lot, but nothing on Jammu. u/bropunzal, in case you are still answering questions: firstly, glad you and your family are safe and as well as can be, in the circumstances. Hope things improve soon, for Kashmir's sake and for India's sake.

My question is this: you have mentioned several times that you fear the intention of the state is to carry out a mass genocide of kashmiri muslims. Why do you think so? My own sense is that the govt doesn't trust that Kashmiris won't choose Pak/independence if they had the option, so it suppresses them with a very heavy hand.  This leads to military rule, firing with live rounds, and custodial killing, but that is very different from a genocide. I think the Indian state, horrible as it is in so many ways, does not have the desire (forget the capacity) to do something as evil as that. What reasons make you certain?

Second: I think the govt's best-case scenario is that somewhat like the Khalistan movement in Punjab or ULFA in Assam or the Mizo movement in Mizoram, Kashmiris will eventually come around. Clearly you believe that is not going to be the case. Why? Do you think it is at all possible that if the govt uses heavy military force to achieve superficial peace, allowing Kashmir to develop and achieve greater prosperity, Kashmiris will eventually find that staying within India is not too bad?

Another question: Given that the Indian state is not going to allow Kashmir independence or even autonomy, what is the best possible outcome that you see happening? If you had a chance to address all fellow Kashmiris, what would you counsel? Azadi at any cost? Keep your head down and carry on, one day we will get them? Or Lets give India (yet) another chance, they are the least worse option? Or something else?

Sorry for so many questions, I couldn't stop at one! Namaskar Mahrah, Tvaahi kaatika jhu? Anatnag?

It is also important for Indian redditors to know this AMA is from a Kashmiri Muslim, they do not speak for Hindus like myself.  Kashmiri Hindus are like 100% with India, and we are thankful for the Jawans here. 

One thing I would say is the Indian Government made mistake by allowing paltry access to landlines during initial days. Talking one minute with family isn't enough, I didn't know anything about my family for a while.  It is a better situation now, but now optimal. India needs to normalize everything sooner better than later, 

Situation will get better and hopefully peace and prosperity will return to the region. Is it safe to travel there with family? If yes please suggest some good peaceful places near mountains Assuming independence isn't feasible, why do you guys wish to join Pakistan over India? Hi! Thank you for doing this.

I have a couple of questions regarding Kashmir. 

1. What's the general opinion in Kashmir about their identity as Indians? I recently learned that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is called Aazad Kashmir by lots of people.

2. While the current situation is absolutely dire (not that it ever was normal with the army being there all the time), are there people who believe the removal of Section 370 can lead to a better future eventually?

Again, thank you so much for doing this. There was a panel in my university about Kashmir, and we had a Kashmiri speak about life growing up there. I can't even begin to fathom how daily shootings have turned into normalcy for the area.
I don't know how things can ever be peaceful, and life can be actually normal there. Hmm, in your opinion, what has Article 370 changed for a common man in Kashmir? There are claims being made that 'grass root' people aka not privileged like upper middle class, are happy that state became UT because now central govt can build metro/flyovers without having to go through the state.

Honestly, state govts don't do shit and do you think that this will be that one good thing for Kashmir? Its good to know you are doing ok. Just keep holding on and I believe everything would be fine. If things go bad always remember there are people who will help. Always. Just keep hanging there bud. Hi, good to know you're safe. 

I read you want Kashmir to go back to its autonomous state. My question is, it's been that way for the past several years, but only thing that's increased is the militancy. Also, if you were to go to Pakistan, only thing you guys would have in common with them is the religion, but Pakistanis kashmiris are having it worse, they aren't happy there. So why do you want things to go back to as they were before? 

Also, stay safe. Cheers. Sorry for what you guys are going through. 
Hope normalcy returns to you soon and bigotry doesn’t affect you.

I wish people learnt history and not cherrypicked only select events. And even if they did, that “revenge” is not the same as “justice”. Hello.

What is the situation like for forest covers in Kashmir? How is the environment doing after years of occupation? Is clean water easy to access everywhere at the moment? 

So you have migrant farm labor from the subcontinent? Or have they returned? Harvest season cannot have been easy, I'm sorry. Sorry, if this is rude. But based on what you feel, how many Kashmiris would want J&K to be a normal state in India, how many want to join Pak and how many want it to be a third country? chutiya cocky ama... totally understand why they deserve detention What can I do to end the lock down? BTW you are from  which district in Kashmir?

Also after the 370 removal if there was no lock down wouldn't more people would have been killed in the violence? If I remember correctly 50+ people were killed after Burhan Wani was killed.

The lock-down is pretty bad and I don't endorse it but if there was no lock-down, much more life would have been lost.Honestly I'm so confused about the whole thing! I think the reason why this is happening is because India doesn't want to give any more 'gifts'(can't think of a better word) to Pakistan. J&K is an important land and people living their won't be given any freedom. You all are just under crossfire between two nuclear powers. Both of them fighting for religious beliefs which is stupid. All I can say is migrate to other countries and leave your home because at the end of the day even I don't think about what conditions you are going through. I have never experienced what you have (and don't want to) and I hate religions. The only religion I believe is survival. Survival at all cost. Well my point is just make sure you survive and help many people survive along with you. J&k will take decades to regain freedom and you don't have that. Its unfortunate to see any effective action from the world community. Imagine if this happens in Europe, they would have quick to change the regime. When 70 % population supports terrorists  government have to take measures. my uncle is deployed in kashmir he say mentality of kashmiri people is of terror. Imo it's good to keep control I am not fully aware of all intricacies (political, historical etc) but full integration is beneficial for J&k, at least in the long run. Why are kashmir people against it? Muslim or Hindu? are you muslim or non-muslim? So in your opinion we let them what they want to do"
AMA,(Verified AMA) I’m a Singaporean of ethnic Indian ancestry.

As a Singaporean of Indian heritage, I’ve come across a growing number of Indian nationals in Singapore – both visitors and expatriates – as well as Indian nationals on various trips around Southeast Asia. Many of them are cognisant of the fact that there is a localised ethnic Indian community in the Malay archipelago (Malaysia and Singapore, and to a lesser extent Indonesia) – but they know little about the intricate details, like our history, our distinct Anglophone culture and distinct religious traditions, the way we've been nativised to this part of the world for centuries and have become a distinctive ethnic group in our own right, and how this makes our contemporary populace differ from the prominent Indian diasporic groups that emigrated to the West largely after India's independence from the British Empire (Indian-Americans, Indo-Canadians, British Indians).

I’d like to use this AMA as an opportunity to foster a greater understanding of Singaporean (and by extension, Malaysian) Indians on r/India. Feel free to ask me anything that relates to our history, our settlement patterns and the circumstances that drove them, our ethnolinguistic profile, our culture, religion, sense of self-identity and conception of nationhood, our perceptions of India, our place in Singapore and our ties with the Malays and Chinese, and really anything along these lines! Cheers, and I look forward to a productive discussion :)",visss9," Is it true that there is a government mandated policy of public secularisation?And if so, is that what you attribute as the reason for low level of ethnic tensions?

How do you people regard Chinese expansionism in your neighbourhood? Do you disregard it since Singapore isn't likely to be on the list? Why is chewing gum banned in Singapore? I just want to say visited Singapore a couple of years back and it's beautiful.

Also, did you watch the movie Crazy Rich Asians? If yes, do you think it is accurate or at least based on some facts? I know the original author was a Singaporean but I just wanted another perspective.

I did read your other replies and I want to just say thanks, I learned a lot today, not excluding the subreddit r/SuddenlyGay :P Is Singapore overpopulated when compared to India When did your ancestors migrate to Singapore? Who's the most famous Singaporean person of Indian descent now ?

I'll be there in 2-3 days. Love the food at hawker centers. 

A friend of mine is working for a silicon valley giant's Singapore office. His home is in a great apartment building but it is extremely tiny. 

Is that the norm in Singapore? His living room was the size of half my bedroom. 

I am seriously considering relocating there but the price of real estate seems prohibitive. Cost of living also seems to be high. Whats up la! 

Which part of India are your forefathers from?

Have you visited India.

Do you have a distinct family tradition passed down from your forefathers? How are the Gorkha police force viewed there. And what percentage of your police force is ghorkha? Awesome ama man. Thanks for doing this. 

What would you say are some of the negative stereotypes Indians have in Singapore? (Both the local ones and the expat ones). 

Another one - a lot of times I’ve seen landlords denying considering Indians for rentals. Why do you think this occurs? Any specific reasoning behind this ? 
Wasn’t there a dissident guy called Joshua Navaratnam? He was jailed.

Why was he jailed?  What is the story? Do you find the Asians to have certain tendencies like ""living amongst their own, avoid others"" ? Is it true that the chinese eat dogs, cockroaches, etc - we hear that a lot. (not an offensive question or meant to be, just curiosity) ? What are your thoughts on Singapore's political system? would you rather have a free, liberal democracy that is poor or an authoritarian one party state that's rich? (that's a big debate in India right now, questioning the innate merit of our free society) Hello! And thank you!  This was quite informative. Thanks for sharing and taking the time out for such detailed replies. Don't you think Singapore is digging their own grave by having stricter PR and work permit laws. The country was essentially built ground up by immigrants?

From where I stand, I think Singapore and its economy can do a lot more if they liberalize their immigration laws a bit and get deserving people from all walks of life. Kyu bhai"
AMA,I have high functioning depression - AMA,16,e5xx1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5xx1e/i_have_high_functioning_depression_ama/,47,"I've had ""high functioning"" depression, aka Dysthymia, (self-diagnosed, sorry) for a very long time - I think at least 18 years now since when I was in high school. I'm not suicidal, and don't plan to be ever, so don't worry about it.

I have a great family and they've been very supportive though they don't know and I don't plan on telling them. Without them, I wouldn't be ""high functioning"" at all. Every aspect of my life has been affected by it and I've accepted it as part of who I am. It decides what I do during the day, what opportunities I take and what I let go.

I'm not looking for advice and support. Not because I don't value them, but just that they won't be helpful to me in practice. Questions will be most helpful since they'll let me understand things better about myself.

AMA if you want to know what it's like and I'll try to answer them tonight. Unfortunately my memory is shot, so that'll affect my answers. Feel free to DM me if your question is too personal.

*Mods, this is just ad-hoc that I thought I'd post and I'm not sure it's appropriate. I'm also going to remain unverified if this thing does get posted, sorry*

Edit: I'll be back later tonight and answer further questions and elaborate on some of my earlier answers. Thanks.

Edit 2: Looks like I've answered all the questions. I'll probably check after a few days for new questions before leaving this completely.

I think what I wanted was for other people in a similar situation to know there's something to gain by fixing things sooner than I have - this doesn't go away automatically. This is a video about the symptoms that I think is pretty accurate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYqFoCsAnTY",tw_dep_x," How did you realize that you have an issue? Would you like to share about the root cause? Can it ever completely go away? I could be wrong but maybe the memory issues is lack of vitamins? Have you got your b12 level Checked? How are you doing physically? Have you considered going to a psychiatrist? how do you deal with depression especially when it starts to affect your productivity and career? > Every aspect of my life has been affected by it and I've accepted it as part of who I am. It decides what I do during the day, what opportunities I take and what I let go.

What exactly happens to you? Can you describe your behaviour, your habits, your thoughts, and how the depression affects you? I have persistent depressive disorder as well. (Stay strong brother 😊).

A lot of what you said is similar to me. I have a master's degree and have always done very well in school, but not without struggles along the way.

My dysthymia (now called persistent depressive disorder in the DSM) is most likely genetic. My great grandmother on my father's side was bipolar. My dad has dysthymia as well. 

The best way to describe it to someone is that my life feels like a black and white television while everyone else lives in color. 

I get really sad sometimes and I have happy moments on rare occasions, but the biggest areas of my life it affects is work and relationships. 

I am currently a school teacher, but I've asked to be released from my contract and I just broke up with my boyfriend. 

It's hard to be alone because that's when I get really sad, but I also get really nervous in novel social situations. You might consider this, one of the older medications that comes with dietary restrictions:

Start some cooperative bank, use the capital and favours for political power. Or, any other way to get some money.

Social media will be big, Start a youtube channel and start at center, overtime, when you have amassed enough power/position, find what will be the biggest group of people and how to polarize that out in your favor.  (For future, i say jobless vs businessmen).

Join college politics and a gym, you will need to beat someone, so that some party superior/ people notice you. You Must get a boost by getting involved in some kind of infamous event.

Join debate teams/clubs, learn how to talk, (make sure you DONT use it for public speaking). But learn how to throw off a sensible discussion, learn promising random shit with stern face. What has motivated you to take on such a challenging task? What is the first thing that you will do when you become PM ? Would you also sleep in the parliament? 

How would you react if the Rahul Gandhi of your time gives you a hug? If a senior minister in your cabinet, that has previously admited on twitter that he urinates on greenery in his government allotted bungalows, and he asks to be excused during a meeting at 7 Race Course, would you insist he use the mens room or stay silent while he does the deed? Where do you stand ideologically? Are you idealistic? What is your opinion on Hindu nationalism? By the time you would be PM , most of us would be dead.

AMA,"My experiences and tales from working at McDonalds, Bombay in the late 2000s. Feel free to AMA about my experiences.",255,dh2foi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dh2foi/my_experiences_and_tales_from_working_at/,100,"  

McDonlad’s franchines began popping up in Bombay around the mid 2000s. One opened near where I lived at the time. I was an engineering student at a decent Bombay college and before the semester exams, I’d be studying at home. My mom would force me to mop the floors and do the dishes. Youth makes most rebel against order and I did too. I told my mom that I’d rather mop the floors at the nearby McDonald’s branch and be paid rather than do the same work at home for no pay. She reluctantly let me try my luck but didn’t have high hopes.

I proved her wrong and was quite smug about it. All I did was to walk into the store a week after it opened, ask for the manager and explained that I was looking for a job. He sat me down, explained the terms and did the expected song and dance. I left my phone number with him and lo and behold, he called the next morning asking when I could begin. I began the following morning.

My tasks consisted of doing anything at the store with two exceptions: I could not operate the fryer as you first had to pass a course and I could not do deliveries as I did not have a two-wheeler license. Anything else was fair game and I manned the counter, served customers, cleaned toilets, manned the take-out counter and yes, mopped the floor.

My hours were 9 AM – 7 PM and the store opened at 10 AM. The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were sinister vegetarians. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went. At home, they thought nothing of abusing the labour of a lower-caste servant and would force said servant to eat and drink from separate utensils. Anything that came into contact with a meat-eater was deemed to have been defiled and must be purified by magic incantations and ritual cleansing with water. These same people once called the police because my family was cooking fish. The irony of eating food at a restaurant that also served chicken was lost on them but that’s partly because they love the gora and anything that the gora sells to them.

Anyhow, once the doors opened at 10 AM, the first wave of customers was invariably college students. Decent people but fairly docile. They viewed McDonald’s servings as the quail and manna of the gods and would rarely complain if the food was substandard which it often was. The evening mom crowd, though, was another story.

#Half information is a dangerous thing

One Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son. They ordered a happy meal for the young meatball and a veggie burger and a coke for madam. There is an internet rumour that chains like McDonalds cheat customers on Coca-Cola by including too much ice. This is not entirely true. The reality is that the syrup coming out of the machine is not entirely diluted and the ice is there for two reasons: to keep the drink cold and to add water. The woman was not aware of this and I served her drink with the standard half-cup of ice. She walked away, found a table and took offence almost immediately. To set the scene, lines when McDonalds first opened in the Bombay suburbs were fairly long and they only kept growing through the day. This woman cuts to the front of the line and accuses me of cheating her with the coke. I said that it was standard practice and even offered to replace her drink with another one. She agreed but kept shouting that I was a cheater. Ok.

I filled a new cup with the coke syrup from the machine and proceeded to add cold water from the fridge. She started screaming at this point and demanded that I fill the cup with the syrup. I acquiesced. She walked away with a cup of sugary coke syrup. One customer later, she was back and again shouted at me and accused me of cheating. I said that I had done exactly as she has asked to which she replied “is that how you talk to your mother” and flung the contents of the cup at my face.

Indians have this disgusting and mistaken belief that if they pay for a service, they own the service staff. Anecdotally, this seems to be prevalent among the upper castes. The manager appeared on the scene because of the commission and sided with the woman. In india, the word of a woman is taken as gospel and the man is automatically the target of the ire of a lynch mob. I was lucky that no violence was involved. At the end of this scene, the front half of my body was a sticky, sugary mess and the woman walked away with a 1000 rupee voucher.

#Beggars

McDonalds have a “food slide” between the kitchen and the counters which is essentially an inclined, stainless steel chute with multiple lanes for food. Once placed, anything on the slide must be on a customer’s place within 90 seconds or it would be binned. Perfectly good food would be binned because it was getting cold. I decided to do a good deed and found a clean bag into which I deposited food from the slide. Good burgers, plenty of fries and a smattering of other “food”. Once done for the day, I took this bag outside and began handing its contents out to the beggars on the street. I was soon mobbed by several but had enough food to go around. They seemed grateful but I did not know what was in store.

The next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food. The manager was called and Ashutosh was not pleased when it was revealed that I the naive was the culprit. I still gathered the food but I took it to the local church and left it to them to distribute it.

#Space hogs

Although it has chairs and tables, McDonalds is a sit-down restaurant in the same way that Bombay is a world class city. This, however, would not deter our local business men (read thugs and politicians) from trying to hold business meetings in the restaurant. One fine evening during the rush hour, we had a local politician from the Congress show up, demand food and to the surprise of everyone there, actually pay for it. He then took his entourage and demanded that seated customers pay obeisance to him by vacating their tables. This being India, they complied and the man proceeded to have a 4 hour and 26 minute meeting there with a party of 24 people. I know because we kept notes. He paid for a big mac and a portion of fries.

#Midnight in Gujarat

Anyone who’s lived near Gujjus will know that many, many gujjus who run their own business have a tendency to eat dinner at 10 PM. McDonalds closed at 10 PM according to the signs but 21:54 was when a torrent of pot-bellied gujju uncles with their puffed-poori wives and kids would line up outside the take-away counter. Although the seating area was off-limits and the front door was closed, Ashutosh would not say no to paying customers. To these gujjus, the sliced buns of McDonald’s bread was like the parted waters of the red sea and I was their Moses. I was often stunned at how much these people ate. I’m a skinny person and I could not eat more than two large McDonald’s burgers. I once saw a man eat 4. In 5 minutes. I worry for his arteries and his wife’s hips.

#Marathi Manoos and the Sena

Fish was once served at our restaurant though it was soon taken off the menu after a group of angry nativists protested. They showed up with the constabulary and orange flags, some with snarling tigers on them and demanded that we stop selling fish, which is apparently haram in staunch Maharashtrian circles. Ashutosh caved and the offending Piscean meat was removed. Another time, the cops showed up with booze and demanded food. They did not pay but sat on the seats, drank and laughed like louts. In the land of the poor, the police are the mafia.

In all, my experience with McDonalds was decent. I worked three months including most of my vacation. I worked 12 hours most days and was paid 350 rupees for each day’s work with no overtime. I worked 6 days a week but the restaurant was open all 7 days, 9 AM – 11 PM for staff (customer hours were shorter). I had the distinct advantage of getting in early when the chain was new and had few employees. I also had the advantage of speaking fairly decent English at a time when most employees did not. If you’re considering this as an option to make some money, things may have changed more recently. I would not recommend eating McDonald’s food regularly. Even the church where I would deposit unused food asked that I stop brining any over. They did not like it because it was oily and would not spoil, the latter causing much suspicion about the contents of the food.

These were my stories from my time there. I have several more, if anyone’s interested. Feel free to AMA about my experiences and thanks for reading.",mcdonalds_bombay," >One Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son.

I chuckled reading this,  your writing style is superlative. I just don't understand why would Sena protest against selling fish and most definitely it is not considered haram in Maharashtrian families maybe strictly vegetarian will not eat it. But most non-veg Marathi families eat fish. >The next morning, as soon as the shutters were raised, within literally seconds, about 100 beggars began banging on the glass window panes demanding food.

Believe me there used to be a time when people from Inorbit, Vashi could be seen dashing all the way to local station with their McD coke to avoid beggars 😂


Man this was an interesting Sunday read. Thanks for sharing it here. >He paid for a big mac and a portion of fries.


You don't get big Mac in India right? Is this fictional OP or just a slip of tongue? :P

Even if so, you do write very well, I'm impressed. Is what you do for a living related to writing? No questions here , but I thoroughly enjoyed your write-up and the humour! Have a great weekend 👍 Did you ever spit in someone's food ?


Slim shady Fake post. Something akin to a writers fantasy. You said marathi people asked you to stop selling fishes in mumbai.  I cannot believe that all. Half the Mumbai marathi population is from konkan where fishes are staple. Mumbai itself has roots in a fishing village and shiv sena half of whom are from konkan themselves asking you to stop selling fish what bullshit. I went to the McDonald's outside vt station the day it opened. It seemed super expensive back then. The outside seating was great. I received excellent service and I even filling out a feedback form. Why won't the foods get spoiled? Some things that sound fake to me:

1. Shiv Sena opposing fish - like others have stated, Shiv Sena have never really had a stance opposing meat or beef (Correct me if I am wrong). In fact, they had flouted government orders and sold meant/fish when it was banned for Jain festivals
2. Woman throws coke at employee and walks away with 1000 Rs voucher - again, I can believe people being rude and still being placated by manager, but, an actual act of aggression like throwing drink at the guy in counter and getting away sounds far-fetched. This is darn funny. Usually well off kids in India don't do part time jobs, it's sad, it's because of the class perceptions. But if anyone is interested, I'd suggest decathlon, they seem to be hiring mostly well off upper middle class college students Wow. Was that interesting! And funny.

1. How long does it take for the food to become inedible?
2. What did you tell the beggars to make them go away?
3. What's the biggest/most disgusting order you ever served?
4. Did you ever come across someone having a heart attack/medical issues in the restaurant?
5. What's so difficult about operating the fryer?
6. Why did you take up engineering instead of writing books in McDonalds? We could have had a desi Hari Patra by now. Please send me a invitation to your book launch, whenever it happens. 😂
7. Isn't fish vegetarian? >  I worked three months

Wow. So many bizarre experiences in such a short time? Are there rats/mouse in McDonalds kitchen? Not entirely sure if this is real but interesting read nonetheless. I am not defending any caste here, but even people of lower caste treat people in retail shitty. In India no one cares about respect for a fellow human, If they are paying you or buying your stuff you are their slave. Upper caste or lower caste, PhD or 10th pass they all behave the same in this shit country. > I once saw a man eat 4. In 5 minutes. I worry for his arteries and his wife’s hips.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) No meat was served at that branch? Nuggets? McChicken? What/ If there are any the shady things McDonalds or other fast food restaurants do with their food? >One Friday evening, I was at the counter when a well-fed gujurati lady walked up with her well-fed son.

That's a classic Karen story. You should post this on r/entitledparents I liked your style of writing! :) Funny :-) What I glean from this is, anyone working in a direct customer-centric position would have rich tales to share about how Indians really are. 
Unpleasant, uncivilized, and hopeless.

You should write more. For some it may be just a job. For others it may be a stepping stone to something altogether different. > The first hour was spent preparing the store for the onslaught of the McDonald’s-craving indian junta many of whom were **sinister vegetarians**. I say sinister because if these people had their way, they would crucify anyone who ate meat. Since they could not do this, they resorted to making a nuisance of themselves everywhere they went.

Nicely worded ! A good start to Sunday morning. 

Thanks. You need to write a book. You write in SUCH an articulate manner! Thank you, I enjoyed reading this immensely. You've covered whatever I was curious about and would have wanted to know. I liked the that it was from the early 2000s. >McDonlad’s franchines began popping up in Bombay around the mid 2000s.

The first McD in Bombay opened in 1996-1997. WTF are you talking about, OP? This is without a doubt one of the best posts I've ever read in this subreddit. Thank you so much for this OP! I throughout enjoyed it. You are a phenomenal writer.

May I know what you do for a living now? Lol, well written. My questions:  
1 How much did you get paid monthly? Any other benefits? 

2 How easy would it be to work your way up the ladder, to become a manager, for example?

3 Could you eat food from there for free? Do you know how to prepare all the different types of burgers? Im trying to remember it all but nothing is coming up online. Thanks if you can help. Very well written sir, I hope you have a good day. Fantastic read ! Thank you for sharing your  time At McD . 
Am rather confused about the fish protest by the Sena. Why would they protest fish ? Ashutosh is an asshole. >McDonlad

Stopped reading right there. Well written post.. It was a good read. Thanks!"
AMA,[Unverified] AMA. Worked as an Amazon Customer Service associate.,44,dmiq6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dmiq6f/unverified_ama_worked_as_an_amazon_customer/,68,,2122_cs_throwaway," Again...what exactly do you do? (1) Customer profile - How does it work? Can you explain in detail about it? Factors that affects customer profile. 

(2) Is it a score decided by software? Or you guys decide yourself when customer calls you and you check order history?

(3) Customer data - How much access do you have? Is it possible for someone to access user data without getting caught? How does Amazon handles this particular issue?

(4) What's the compassion for late delivery complaints? If delivery guy is responsible for late delivery, what happens to him? (Negative points, something like that??)

(5) Decisions- Do you have freedom to decide on your own(at least in some areas) or you just have to follow a script or rules all the time?  
  


(6) Customer behaviour - Some customers are very rude. How do you deal with that & How does it affect you?

(7) About your job- What are the factors that decides your performance? Do you have any targets? What's your promotion criteria? Do you think Amazon cares enough about customer care experience & representatives? What is the starting salary. I hear that they offer free launch. Is that true? Your office has pictures/statues of the bald billionaire? They give you incentives for working overtime during sales? Whenever I feel lonely, I troll call you guys. Can you forgive me? Also, please don't issue those warnings to me. I just want a friend. Throw light of some un-ehtical practices there. What was the weirdest conversation you've had with a customer?

edit: letters How does your Superiors treat you? Do you know what happens in the background when the last mile delivery folks fuck up? I know CS isn't responsible for what happens here but I'm hoping you have some insight. 

I've had far too many instances of these guys lying on the app as to why they couldn't deliver it to me on the day that it went ""out for delivery"". They also tend to never pick up the phone or promise to deliver one day even if they do but still end up postponing a day. 

For instance, the updated status at the end of a day will be ""Customer requested reschedule"", ""Customer not available"" etc. They are obviously lying because I often wfh if I know a package is expected.

FWIW, I live in the middle of Bangalore. Do those 'SORRY' or '50OFF' ""lifehacks"" ever work? Thanks for doing this  


* Isn't this outsourced to third parties most of the times? Why is amazon having a dedicated team for this? Or has this been the case due to quality being low from third parties. 
* Have you worked as a customer service associate before?
* Are you aware of companies which get outsourced support work, which companies then hire to do support work? Dumb question: Any history of CS associates jumping to a different career within Amazon itself? Like a project manager et al Does your address get blocked if you refuse to take delivery of products too many times?

My family orders a lot from Amazon. And we refuse delivery for around 5% orders [deleted] Do you have a daily quota for how many refunds you can issue? How often and regular are the promotion there in the CS team? 

Will an average employee who works as per his working hours, maybe once here or there does overtime, will they get promoted?

Are your working hours fixed? I meant is a 8 hr shift 8 hours or does it change too? If it changes, do they pay you more? What about shift timings? Do they keep on changing? 

How frequently do you get your leaves for vacation? How many are alloted to you?

The abuse Amazon gets for overworking the employees, is that true? Or is it just specific for warehouse employees? Hey when there is an issue with delivery during Black Friday. Like Shipping lost and the customer never received the item. What are the options you can offer to the customer when the discount is not available on the item anymore ? For example, 150$ difference on item price. 

&#x200B;

How much credit could you offer at Max ? 20 ? 50 ? 100 ? 

Could you offer a discount code on this item to match the price ?

Could you offer Amazon gift card to match the price ? 

&#x200B;

Thank you for your answer, What Qualifications do you need to be an Amazon CS guy? What is their interview process like? Are the offices spread out elsewhere in India or just Coimbatore? Is it illegal to share prime account by my friend who lives in the different city altogether?"
AMA,World Mental Health Day AMA,90,dfgd0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dfgd0x/world_mental_health_day_ama/,124,"Hello, we are Bangalore based NGO, [White Swan Foundation](https://www.whiteswanfoundation.org). Ask us anything. Since the last time we met, we have grown not only in our team strength but also, in our work. We now have a mental health program for workplaces as well as schools.

Currently we are running a program called October Allies where we believe that everyone can be a mental health ally. We ask everyone to take the pledge and make the conversations around mental health commonplace. You can take the pledge [here.](https://www.whiteswanfoundation.org/october-allies/view/)",mentalhealthind," The White Swan Foundation (u/mentalhealthind) is a non-profit organization that works in the field of knowledge creation to address mental health concerns, including suicide prevention, in India. You can read more about them and their work on their website, here. https://www.whiteswanfoundation.org/about-us/who-we-are/

October 10 is World Mental Health Day - do join us here with the White Swan Foundation to discuss resources, challenges, and support for mental health in India. I think the first thing anyone who wants to seek mental help wants to know is: Who do you go to first to seek help? A psychologist or a psychiatrist? Everyday i think i am useless and their is no hope for me in future. I am highly unproductive at job and on the verge of being fired. I find it hard to mantain relationships. It's been long that i stopped living and now, just existing. What did i do to deserve this. 

I am no attention seeker. Excuse me if i seem to be one. 

What should i do? What advice would you have for students who study in high intensity educational environments like Kota and their parents? How do you check the status of your mental health? Hey there , how do I explain a sense of emptyness in me I worked hard have good friends but end of the day I really still feel empty sometimes, don't get me wrong it's not that I am always sad or something but it's just feels there is no point in busting my ass to get to work or maintain relationships with friends or gf, also how can I help or do my part in Ngo or help someone who is going though tough times cause some of my friends are relctunat to get help or visit a psychiatrist given that most people consider getting help from a professional as a taboo ( my view and observation) , also what are your thoughts about online therapist ? Thank you appreciate the job you guys are doing. Do you think that staying in this country and it's conditions (social, structural)etc has an impact on our mental health besides the fact that there are no facilities that help with such mental health related issues What can be done to promote the awareness of mental health? We only tend to go to a therapist when things go out of control How do I find therapists in  India? All I see are psychologists or psychiatrists. Aren't these the ppl who like to solve it via medicines instead of mental therapy? Any updated pan-India list of mental health professionals that you can share? How much of mental health research is happening in India? For some weird reason, mental health has not been given its due importance in this country, education as well as the medical condition. What has your organization done to influence the policies of our nation towards educating and improving mental health? How should I breach the topic of rehab with a friend who is slipping into dangerous addiction? What's a movie that you've seen that addresses something mental health related, that handles the topic with the gravity that it deserves? A lot of media tends to make light talking about this kind of stuff: ""ah, he's a mental person, send him to Nimhans!""

(For context: growing up, I always thought of nimhans as some kind of Arkham Asylum-esque place with padded cells and free straitjacket on check in. Which made me hesitant to receive help from there, when I needed it.) Visited a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. Let's see how it goes. What's a decent plan of action for someone (young adult) who suspects himself to be on the autism spectrum? A lot of mental health symptoms match with general lethargy and sadness, which is really natural. So my question is, 
just like there is a lot of content about how to **diagnose** depression/anxiety from early symptoms, do you have a checklist or something to **rule out** depression/anxiety?  Like dude, just get more sunlight and proper diet, rest, have a plan and you're good to go! I live in existential crisis. As  a result I underperform in my field compared to my peers. I have sever anxiety and stress issues. I met a doctor who gave me some tablets and I didnt find them of any help. Do you have any suggestion? I’m a doctor just out of medical school. I am really interested in psychiatry. I just want to know how much stigma is still associated with mental health and has it decreased a lot compared to the olden days ? And what can you guys do to curb that stigma ? Hey, you guys are doing good work!

What can be done about mental health awareness among the more poorer and/or backward areas of the country? There's been an uptick in mental health awareness among the urban areas and the socio-economically better off regions, but taboos and non-access to proper treatment run rampant still in other regions. Anything from neuroses to major psychoses like schizophrenia or depression are still left undiagnosed and untreated. What is the way to go forward for alleviation and awareness? Hey.

As a med Prof, I would like to know how does your organization/ team handle all the anti mental health and anti psychiatry viewpoints which are prevalant at large in our society? 

How do you handle the basic line said by these people that mental illnesses are just fraud and that these things can be healed with being strong etc.? 

How do you handle the way people perceive medicines especially anti depressants? Do you guys have the proper information and even importantly, the proper way to convey the myths regarding the medications which public has?

And lastly, how do you add psychiatristd and psychologists to your team? What is their role in your organization and do you serve as a third party to direct patients towards them? Is 4 hours of sleep healthy for a student? Great initiative, and thank you for the answers so far. My question is how do you explain the importance of mental health to teenagers? What needs to be done differently? Whats your advice for a guy who's 28, finished engineering in a mediocre University, currently in a mediocre job in automotive industry With a less than mediocre  pay,who doesn't hate the job,but also doesn't like it that much,who hasn't been in any relationship (i kinda choose not to,who am i kidding),always feeling lazy all the time the thing is i just dont have any dream or whatsoever i feel like my life is headed towards nothingness,i cant concentrate myself on anything productive at all i just  pass my time watching anime and some tv series,i can feel i am wasting my life/time but i just cannot make myself up to do something productive or useful to my life or others ... What can I do to help? Is having multiple personalities healthy?

Showing that you are really happy in front of others, Keeping a smile on face but coming home and breaking down being lonely?

Overworked overambitious professional who sacrified his personal life for a career Going to psychiatrist for 4 years now, started going to psychologists for 2 weeks.hopefully situations would get improve Is marijuana really trigger Psychosis, schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorders. I'm really concerned for my friends. Something this question give me anxiety if my friend get the disorder from smoking marijuana. are you looking for volunteers? if yes, how can I help? We have a 50+ old relative , who is abusive , alcoholic and smoker, has a sense of superiority, lacks empathy. He indulges in dangerous driving, sometime walks naked, seeks attention in inappropriate ways, speaks about killing. He barely sleeps. We have approached mental health specialists, but they say they cannot see the patient unless the patient comes to them. Are there specialists who do home visits or accept videos ? 
Especially during bad episodes, is there scope for involuntary admission to protect the family ? Apart from consulting a mental health expert, what other resources/tips one should look out for? What can be done to curb anxiety. I just can't get things done at all? Why is it that the cost for seeking professional help is high not only in India but all over the world when the very professionals insist that mental illnesses should be treated equal to physical illnesses and are basic to every human? How does one find a suitable psychologist? I've tried a number of them but haven't really found one I'd like to pay a second visit to. My mind often wanders into different things. I am not able to focus in class is that too a mental health issue ?
if yes how can you deal with it? In a country where everyone's mostly middle class, how can anyone justify(not knowing how important mental well-being is) the insanely high cost of mental healthcare? 

Also, I've heard people say 'depression is a disease of the rich' which might just be true. If the lack of wealth forces you to function properly without mental healthcare, why get rich? I from the past few months not getting the same level of excitement or happiness from the things i used to do in the past....everything feels mundane to me....and i have been having very negative and dark thoughts regarding my future, my family and myself it has amplified these months and its hard to shake these thoughts of my mind.....and i always feel like something is holding me back but i don't know what and what to do about it....the last thing is that i just want to be free of these dark thoughts and negativity it really hampers my confidence and amplifies the anxiety....What do i do How do I keep myself motivated and energetic when all I want to do is lie down and stare at the ceiling?

AMA,AMA: Moved to India for MBBS. Would love to answer questions about my overall experience. Ask away!,34,dpfwv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dpfwv9/ama_moved_to_india_for_mbbs_would_love_to_answer/,34,"Details: Parents moved to the US in 2000. Did my entire schooling (elementary, middle, high, college) in the States. Post MCAT & looking down at the prospect of taking out loans to attend the med-school I really wanted to, Dad suggested moving to India & getting my MBBS for a fraction of the cost & moving back to the States to pursue postgrad. I graduated uni w. a BSc in May '13, moved to India in June '13 & started med-school in Aug '13. Finished my house surgency in March '19 & am currently stateside clearing my boards for postgrad.

Will definitely answer any & all questions about my 6 year stay in the motherland. Fire away.",dheezy23," How hard is it to get into Indian mbbs program if average student in US? Not to hijack the thread, but does anyone  have any experience of doing a master's in India? I'm non-Indian origin and from the United States. I'm in my mid-twenties, speak Hindi well and am planning to do a year-long language course from August onward. Hoping to do a master's in sociology or a related topic at JNU or DU before going back to the U.S. for a PhD.

I actually want to center my doctoral studies on India. TBQH I've spent several years of my life in India already. Seems like doing a master's there would help me improve my Hindi and build some bridges in academia. They have foreign student quotas, right? My undergrad cGPA is iffy, although I 4.0'd everything for my last 2.5 years as a student.

(also, the cost of doing my entire master's in India comes out to 50% of what I pay for a single semester as an undergrad here)

Again, sorry for getting a bit off topic. If you have any pertinent info, OP, I'd be happy to hear it from you (or from anyone else). Like I said, I've spent a cumulative sum of some 3-4 years in India already, so I have a good idea of what to expect in terms of conditions and education. However, I'm really not acquainted with admissions procedures as an international student. Also, what's the process for coming back to US and getting residency and difficulty of getting residency? Hey, that's nice.

Where did you do your UG from?

Did you have to give NEET UG?

How are you preparing for USMLE?

Do you have any interests in pursuing NEET PG? If you could do it all over again what would you do differently? What was different about the US when you returned?

Wish you all the best in your postgrad pursuits. [deleted] What city did you stay in for your MBBS? What was the experience like considering you were raised in the USA? Was there a culture shock?

Where were you posted for your residency? Did Indian villages prove a difficult nut to crack? Did you get laid during your time here? If yes, then storytime! Man, private colleges in Andhra Pradesh are a disaster. I did my diploma in some random private medical college in North Andhra and it sucked so bad, it was almost comical. Empty wards, fake patients, fake staff, no infra for sports (though I had this pathetic excuse for a gym right next to my room) and horrible horrible food. It was an overall mess and I'm glad I'm done. The only plus, the college was located on a hill and the weather was fantastic. [deleted] Thanks for coming and wasting one medical seat. We have absolute shortage of doctors here and that seat could have been better utilised for a doctor who would practice in India."

- Which country are you from?

- What course are you pursuing here?

- What you thought of India and Indians before your course? 

- Any perceptions that changed after your visit or the ones which proved right later? Is the cost of education in India lower than your native country? And why did you choose India (among others) for the course you are persuing? Finally, are there any (if any at all) features of Indian education system you want to see in your own country's system?

AMA,American IT person here. Would like to learn more so we can better communicate. Lets chat. AMA,25,dd0s0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dd0s0o/american_it_person_here_would_like_to_learn_more/,51,"Hi /r/india. Im just your average american guy who works with people from and in India every day. Id love to just have an open conversation with you all to help better understand your culture and how to avoid things that are not ok to talk about as well as just general life across the planet from me. I respect everyone of you for all the hard work you do for american companies, but looking to understand more. Thank you!",MarioKartGuy27," Pay us or atleast treat us like humans. You go out the door at 5 without any guilt, do the same for your Indian counterparts. Give them days off, or demand consulting companies that you contract that they do the same. Make sure their bosses are not complete assholes.

Doing this is far better than understanding the culture, everyone is in it for the money. >  everyone of you for all the hard work you do for american companies, but looking to understand more. Thank you! 

Not all IT guys in India work for American firms.

You can tell them about American way of exchanging pleasantries before a meeting. Or the idea of stating the facts without sugarcoating.

And, understand that factors like https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distance are at play in the background.

 Language, accent, syntax etc is mere medium for exchanging ideas and communication. But there are things at a deeper level that cause more serious kinds of disconnected , which typically never get addressed because both parties are unaware of these things. Food is a great way to connect and just be honest about it, whether you like Indian food or not. Likewise expose them to the American cusine you think would bridge the gap Since you are American, you are rich; so please give me some American money. Like a one million money. No conversation about religion and politics. Other than those you can pretty much have any kind of conversation with an Indian. Indians are not really private people so it's fine to ask them few personal questions too, that being said what's with Americans and their reluctance to talk about which state they belong to in USA, I have met few Americans abroad who gave vague replies about which state they come from. That's something common for an Indian to ask other Indian. Well in my experience pretty much everything is alright.  


One major difficulty that Americans face while communication is the english that we tend to use. The primary reason for it is a lot of us try and translate from our native language to english and the meaning is lost in translation. I doubt it has anything to do with accent.

&#x200B;

Other than that ask questions, we love being asked about our culture and food. Also since India is a diverse beyond measure, ask them which part of India they are from and what's the specialty of that part.  


And when you feel that things might be inappropriate, just say it with ""We in America have ..... "" or ""Americans usually do ..."" which will help point out that you understand things can be different in 2 countries and most Indians would get your point or at least tell you that it is an inappropriate thing to say. >how to avoid things that are not ok to talk about as well as just general life across the planet from me

Average Indian IT guy here. I work with people from USA as well as the Indians now settled in USA every day from age 30 to 45. I have never been to USA or any other country in Americas so my opinion is might be biased.

My opinion \*starts here\*

1. Indians are in USA for good lifestyle, good money but they do miss their home back in India. We love your dollar pizza and cheap supermarkets like Costco. Indians do think to move back to India from USA, and some do, but those who stay are there for a reason.
2. Indians do not like the harsh weather in USA, specially winters.
3. Vegas, SF, and LA is on the travel bucket list of most people who moves from India to USA.
4. People from USA are smart, intelligent and courteous, atleast that is case for people on east coast & west coast. Not sure about states in central part of USA.
5. I hear about Trump from social media everyday. That guy likes to be in limelight. But seriously, whats wrong with him? On the other hand, with numerous scandals on her charts, Hillary is no saint herself.
6. People lose virginity quite early, and sex is quite common among high schoolers. But there would be fare share of exceptions as well (solely based from watching TV series).
7. I have never understood what are *Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism, and Scientology* but I come across these terms often.
8. USA (in some cases, CIA) is responsible for some really fucked up shit around the world, I'm talking Cuba, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Vietnam, Afghanistan to name some. Honestly, USA should stay away from politics of other countries, which is a nice way of saying stop invading other countries.
9. Invading Area 51, Burning Man, lots of national parks, open mindedness, culture and people of USA is lit.
10. Drug problem is serious in some states of USA. And I'm not talking about Marijuana.

\*ends here\*

I hope none of this offends you, as I said I have my biases that might have some into picture. If you have any corrections & questions on history, religion, sex, anything you want to ask, lets hear them out. I haven't had any trouble working with Americans in over a decade, infact I prefer Americans over most other nationalities when it comes to work because you make it a point to have a life outside the office which means I dont have to either. I absolutely hate the work culture of the Japanese, Chinese, Singaporeans or Germans which puts work above all else. I do however hate working with people of Indian/Asian origin in the US because they somehow embrace all the negative stereotypes of Americans more than the rest of you.

If I were to pick favorites, I would go with southerners because they feel like they're warmer people - less business like - and interactions feel more collegial.

Something off about your females though, then men I have worked with/under are always chilled out but somethings perpetually bugging your women man, they are cutthroat :P peace. If you learn to stop stereotying, you are good to go. Also, don't eat cow while in India. (On second thought: that is a difficult task anyway, unless you have sharp claws and strong and sharp teeth.) What about gaming? gaming is kind of taboo here. how about for you? and how many of your indian colleagues do you think are closet gamers? [deleted]"

Flyovers became a waterfall . 3 feet water on road . Thodi der Reddit kya nahi dekha reverse AMA khatam bhi hogaya Story Time : Crush was in a long term relationship, we used to talk a lil bit in the office. First year of office we had formed several groups, people who would hang together, party together etc. I tried to pull her into our group (coz her group was a lame group that I felt was just 3girls and their admirers) . Me and a wingman would try to get her to join us on tea breaks, house parties etc but the fffin girls in our group just wouldn't let her feel accepted so that didn't happen.

I would flirt a little, as much was acceptable in an office environment. She would come sit on my desk sometimes to talk, so it seemed like we were on good terms. I honestly had no intention of  going after someone that was already taken but she was nice to be around.

Then I learned that shes hit a rough patch in her relationship. She didnt tell me this herself so I couldn't outwardly react to this development. Same sources confirmed that the breakups final, I was overjoyed but counting days thinking it would be insensitive to try to make a move right away.

Its Valentines day and I'm are out with a few friends for drinks. She walks into the same joint and I light up, this may be the best time to make a move I think. I pull her to the bar counter, get her a drink and we take a couple jabs at each other, then notice a guy standing a little bit behind her eyeing me. She introduces him as a friend. I ask them to join us at our table, they say they have other friends incoming. We part ways.

Cut to Last week. She married that guy. He proposed on THAT DAY.

TLDR : While I was waiting like an ass for an appropriate amount of time to pass after her breakup, this dude moved in like a hawk and was the kandha she needed I guess. I have learned my lesson, Never again. Listened to Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time.

I dunno what happened and I love it. If you feel you are sinking *Jaane Woh Kaise Log The Jinke Pyar Ko Pyar Mila*

useful to the undergraduate students. The exposition of each concept is extremely lucid. In carefully formatted
chapters, besides problems and short questions, a number of objective questions have also been included. This
book can certainly be extremely useful not only as a textbook, but also for preparation of various competitive
examinations
Those who have followed Dr Verma's scientific work always enjoyed the outstanding contributions he has
made in various research areas. He was an outstanding student of Physics Department of IIT Kanpur during
his academic career. An extremely methodical, sincere person as a student, he has devoted himself to the task
educating young minds and inculcating scientific temper amongst them. The present venture in the form of
these two volumes is another attempt in that direction. I am sure that young minds who would like to learn
physics in an appropriate manner will find these volumes extremely useful
I must heartily congratulate Dr Harish Chandra Verma for the magnificent job he has done.*

Some are busy appeasing Hindus (BJP) while others are busy appeasing Muslims (TMC, CPIM), but nobody cares about our Rights. Sonal Edamaruku, a rationalist, was kicked out of our country because he debunked some superstitions. In Koran, Bible and Gita, God repeatedly insults us atheists and Hindus, Muslims, Christians, etc read them aloud freely. But when we atheists speak something about religions, people become angry, start saying how we are the bad guys, how we are 'hurting their sentiments'.

Dude, you Muslims constitute for 14% of Indian population. We atheists and non-religious don't even represent 1% of the population. Today I was banned from an Indian Discord server because I was questioning a Pakistani about their blasphemy laws and the mods said ""don't hurt their sentiments"". Lol, have you ever cared about OUR sentiments? Link your newly found songs.

AMA,India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!,4400,bfrh0g,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,619,,prabot," Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?

b. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?

c. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..

1. Which module(s) were you part of?

2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?

3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?

4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?

5. What was your preferred method for DFT?

6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?

7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?

8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.

Thanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn't the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm really interested in the field of architecture.
Does this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. 

Something like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!

I'm guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I'm currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What's the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  
 
PS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?

Summing up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)

P.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!

Are you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?

Also how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.

How realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? 

- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?

- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?

- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    
   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             
               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don't really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! [deleted] That is so fucking cool. Kitna deti hai? I don’t know much about processors or about tech in India but it looks cool and you have my upvote We were told you were making this, in VJTI. One time Prof. Girish Kumar mentioned this too. Congratulations on its completion. 💜 Now we’ll have to call America for support Respect bro A wonderful achievement itself , I hope that we can see India producing microprocessors with the likes of Intel or AMD's flagship microprocessors at a cheap rate and paving the new generation of microprocessors for the betterment of technology and the country soon enough. Congrats, you've made us proud! Btech or Mtech Honest question: why have you started this AMA on a Sunday past midnight? fabrication ? 
10 nm ? x86, ARM or something new? Can it run Crysis? [deleted] Which Architecture dose it support and what is max data carrying and crunching capacity of this processor ? Where and by whom did you get the fabrication done?

Do you think we can get mobile phone manufacturers to set up high volume fabrication (not assembly, which are already in few places or will be) plants in India? 
Congratulations quite happy to see development of a processor in India 
Can you list the issues facing the semi conductor development and  fabrication sector in our country? like we do not have a single fab company That manufacturers of devices could use What is the distance between its transistors? How did you get into the process of creating it? How does it differ from other processors in terms of performance and efficiency? I am assuming there must be some caveats as this is a new project so can you please mention them. Specs details? Are you looking to make it an industry standard, if yes, what advantage does it have over intel or similar popular processors First of all many many congratulations..!! 
So what are the future plans? Only use it for the systems and applications you mentioned above? Or near future you have any commercialization plans for this processor to be used in PC's? How can i be involed in any manner in any kind of process within this project? . Damn keen on knowing/understanding this development. [deleted] Wasn't Shakti the first one?
How similar are the two?
Major applications? Could you please share what processor node this was based on? Is it market ready or still a kind of prototype? If it is market ready, what are the next plans for use of this mp? But the real question is, can you game with it? RISC based ? How is it compared to the currently available same type of processors? Thanks for the ama!
Some questions I have-

1. What tools did you use for apr? And does Iit bombay have good license support?

2. You mentioned you’re moving to 65, which fab would this be made by?

3. Does Scl supply any memory compilers?

4. How much of the chip was made in custom?

5. Why did you use vhdl instead of system verilog? Why have you named it Ajit man ? We already got a ""Ajit Pai"" meme, the dude who tried to destroy internet, now soon we will have Ajit processor meme's, why on Earth would you name a processor Ajit ? Why not something like Arjun, Drona, Bhishma, Ram, Shiv, Karna, Karma, Duryodhan, Ravan, Hanuman, Bajrang, Vayu, Trimorti, Bheem or anything else ? So this is different from the “Shakti” processor from IIT Madras? This looks really cool. What desktop processor does it compare to in terms of performance ? I have answered a lot of questions in a short while. I think I will come back after a bit. Please keep the questions coming I am really excited about upcoming questions. Where do plan to get it fabricated at 65nm? Is SCL starting fabrication at 65nm? Is Mass production of this going to happen in India or abroad? I read you said it'll be mass produced at an aim of 100rs but will that be possible to be done within in India? Does India have a leap-frog advantage of starting late in this field? Like the lack of credit cards was okay since we leap frogged to finance apps for credit Don't know much about processors but that looks gorgeous This is exicitng. 
Nano meter? Also do you think we'll be able to mass produce? If AJIT was comparable in performance and speed to a commercially available processor that was made in the past, which one would you equate it to? Any reason behind the name AJIT ?  
Also, congrats and good luck What incentive do businesses have to design their products using this processor? Does it require external cooling? Or is the IHS enough to cool this processor? What kind of power consumption can it handle? Also does What kind of TDP applies to it. You've made so proud and happy OP we need more of you. How complicated is the manufacturing for this processor? Process node? Are there any public papers on how their transistor performance compares to competitors ? What are some pros and cons from x86 and Arm Congratulations :D How commercially viable is this processor. When ARM, Intel and AMD are flooded the market. Do you have any plans to sell Dev kits like raspberry pi? What exactly has been built from ground up? Is it the ISA? Is is the underlying VLSI? Is the actual fab done in India? Can it make me a sandwich? What next? It's 2019 ffs. Congratulations OP. You guys have accomplished a enormous task. I am proud of you people. Some questions if you don't mind.

1-Are guys planning to release an SoC of this.?
2-Is there 64 bit or further in the future?
3-How many no of transistors does it have?
4-Is it able to run the Linux Kernel?
5-What was the most challenging part in the design of the AJIT? Why didn’t we make it any time sooner? What were the challenges that stopped us from making this processor in earlier decades?
There are some really famous and efficient processors readily available in the market at affordable price. Are you planning to get this project to that level or is it only for research purposes. Compare it with something like ARM7 / ARM M4 ? I’ve installed a chip like that by hand. Hand formed, hand soldered. This is a remarkable feat but this causes a brief flashback. Aside from the awesome technical accomplishment,  I must also acknowledge the pleasing aesthetic of your product.

Congratulations! Hey great work indeed. How big are the dimensions of current processor? I’ll buy a development board if there ever is one available! Does it have a built in serial UART? Where did you copy-pasted the design? You just made my point Could you tell us the specifications? Transistor size, density, etc. What level of clean room is available to you? 100? Techniques used for lithography and masks.

I'm also intrigued by the code to hardware thing. I'd guess specialized hardware runs orders of magnitude faster as opposed to generalized ones. 

Would it be possible to make a chip for a particular time consuming program(say photo shop or matlab) making it much cheaper hardware wise if you wish to use it for a singular purpose. Making it sort of cartridges like which used to be case with nes video games making it impossible to pirate a software.

Also most of the specialized machines (SEM, TEM) we have run on way old computer software e.g. 95 and 98 as they don't invest in drivers for newer version of windows. Would it be possible to replace the controller of these machines with a single use computer.

Also is anyone working on quantum computing? People are trying to build it up from scratch so wouldn't it be better if we could jump on it. More like mobile revolution happened in India skipping the landline revolution. OP can you suggest me some resources on 8086. IWTL I have a genuine doubt about something being called 'indigenous'. What does it really mean? hope this captures diy market and helps developing prototype projects quickly Congratulations on your success. Even though i dont know anything about computers. But this looks interesting. Well done! Could this guy run Linux? What sort of I/O does it provide? (Ethernet, GPIO, I2C, etc) where is it manufactured?? Btw great job.  What’s with the name? Any chances for a cooler name that appeals to the millennials? Why the naming? It sucks so bad.. get a ambitious name atleast. First of all congratulations! Its great achievement.

Does it have its own Instruction set? Is it RISC or CISC? How come only a few newspapers and reddit will celebrate these achievements which come out of IITs and IISc ? This is awesome. Congrats. But, since you mentioned the “future,” I am wondering if you and your team are ready to bypass all patents for chip manufacturing. Eg. developed patentable creative way of developing it without interfering prior arts. 

I wonder why military can’t use foreign chipsets; maybe reverse engineering to make sure it does what it does would be sufficient enough and cost effective. How many masks were needed to fabricate this? How long will it take to launch it to market
And what more improvements are we looking at? can you please state the specs Is there a reference manual and a compiler?

What are the advantages of developing own microprocessor compared to picking up an ARM reference architecture and customizing it for your own requirements? How much cooling does it require? Is it passively cooled? Asking since the clock speed isn't something in Ghz.

&#x200B;

What kind of motherboard or accessories does it require to work? What about things such as RAM and other hardware controllers like storage or other things? (sorry if question isn't clear I'm not much of a Chip guy lol.) any chance of a micro controller/processor like arduino/rspbpi? with peripherals? Congrats! How long did the whole project take to reach up to this prototype? What's the power consumption of this prototype?

How do you come up with the Rs 100 estimate of mass produced cost?

What's the minimum feature size/technology node of the fab process for Ajit?

Do the power consumption and performance meet the envisioned use case for satellite deployment? Hiya OP, I'm glad you guys have done this, it's quite something, do you plan on building anything in the future for desktop grade architecture? Cheers! what is the ISA for this processor? are there any benchmarks? what architecture was used to produce this RISC or CISC..?? Yay Considering the many processors that are currently in the market, could you please tell us how this compares or rather how this is better? Could you also lay the difference in cost when comparing with other processors in the same category?

Now that this was fabricated in India where do you see the future of of microprocessor fabrication in our country?

EDIT: how would this compare to an ARM, raspberrypi and so on? Can we expect this to be commercially available for home projects? Can it run minesweeper What will be the benchmark processor if we wish to compare with other popular ones. ? Will this be commercialized, and actually be able to compete with processors by other big companies? Cost less than rs100 if produced on a mass scale? How much does a processor of same specs cost in the market? What is the assumed profit margin to your product? Does it work? What educational background do I need to join your team? Reading through all the comments and sub-comments, I can't help but wonder that this AMA is a supreme example of how an AMA should be. [deleted] Hi there,

I have a couple of questions (3 infact)

1. Why do we not have our own indigenous processors that compete with the likes of Giants like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Exynos or Kirin? I mean its been so long, we have some greatest brains in our country.
2. Not offending anyone, but we could have probably reverse engineered the process or taken help from engineers who have previously worked for these companies. Why do we have to start from scratch? Why start from Mhz? Why not directly Ghz? (atleast 1 Ghz would be good. Enthusiasts would probably buy this instead of the Raspberry Pi and provide some funding to the research)
3. At this rate, how long do you think will it take to reach a competitive level in terms of the ""nm"" tech.? (Please don't say near future) Which programmable chip (I am assuming some FPGA) did you use for testing AJIT? I will try a HPC around it. Xilinx devkits are really good at combining softcores and provide an on-board ARM processor to build a complete embedded system where you can accelerate hardware and use ARM's existing computational capabilities. 1. How long did it take to complete the entire ASIC flow? 
2. Is there a spec sheet available? Im all in for indigenous technology..But don't you think we are bit too late in the processor making race. Even mobile processors have achieved GHz capacity with half a dozen parallel cores with integrated peripherals. Even if we catch up with the big players in the market, we will still need to build the ecosystem around it, do you think we can do that ? 

I agree this is just a start, we can use low frequency processors in a lot of military, industrial and household equipments - microwaves, washing machines, are you guys looking at a niche within that or is it going to be some heavy computing in future?

And, i kinda feel that government wants to make headlines with this, every government in india does that, how is their support in the long term ? 

Also, this is a very huge opportunity, it feels great to be a part of something this big. How is the diversity in the public institutions that support this kind of leg room in technological research ? Kudos Brother / Sister. :) Hearty congratulations on your Achievements

Brutal Question
Do you plan to implement a secret CPU running inside the processor which has complete remote access, similar to Intel's **Management Engine** or AMD's **TrustZone**?

If not how would you takle pressure from government authorities in case it is mandated. Benchmarks pls Reading AJIT on that chip triggers me because of AJIT PAI. 

Nonetheless, Kudos for this achievement OP and his team. Can it run crysis? Hi, I am so interested in designing microchips and processors. Being part of a team that develops such products is so awesome! I am currently on my way to enter Mtech VLSI in one of the NITs. Can you suggest some essential tools/skills that'll help me to get into such industry? I am from electronics background and circuits have always fascinated me. Wrong, IIT Madras developed 'SHAKTI' processor in Nov 2018 Looks like arc reactor from Ironman 2 (it's square instead of triangle). One question though, how is it different from other processors in the market (despite it would be produced in India) and are we planning to mass produce it here? And congratulations, this marks a success!! I initially thought, it was a carom board. Well done! When will it be mass produced? So you started from wafer level? How did you get all the etching done? That's a very nice and insanely costly thing to have to just make one chip, isn't it? Any plans to build GPUs? u/prabot kudos on the success. I had a query. What is the socket/pin description for AJIT? Wasn't Shakti the first one???
Please correct me if I'm wrong. How many nanometers? Can it compete with STM 32? What architecture is it? Is it a new one? Comparable with STM 32? Architecture? Btw wasn't riscv based shakti released before your processor? All I see is that you're going for the embedded market, but every story I read describes the AJIT as a microprocessor. Are you planning on making a microcontroller with this architecture or is it meant to be a processor only?

I mean a 32bit 100MHz uC for approx 2usd would be sweet, although I don't, from a marketability standpoint, understand why you went with the sparc v8. I guess licensing ARM would render the chip too expensive.

I'm going to stick with AVR and ARM for now, but I wish you good luck with the AJIT. Does it do the needful? PAPA ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta is in Intel making 10nm processors /s Show bobs and vagna RISC V ARCH I Guess ? what does it run?, what architecture is this? , what's the benchmark? 
any link to such details would be appreciated.

Nice work though. Will there be any requirement of operating system / kernel developer ? 
What will be Applications ? I'm really intersted in learning this stuff (designing processors / how processors work) do you have any book recommendations? But can it run Crisis? Do you hope to rival other processor manufacturers such as intel and AMD in their processing power? Or aiming to excel above their standards? Would you say that the price would be similar or cheaper? And final question, would you also manufacture a cooling system that best suits this new processor that is both light weight and highly efficient? If so you got my complete support! Is nanotechnology a buzzword or will it make an impact? Thank you for sharing this!  Just curious why choose C and not C++ Oh wow to my gaming mind that looked similar to  pc processor lol, but im still amazed and hopefully this will be the technological boost needed to push india into the forefront of technological development can it be used as raspberry pi for learning. if yes will it be commercially available at a cheaper price than pi? Can I play Skyrim with it? I Salute you anyway. Where do you see India in the next 10 years in this particular field ? Are there any mega plans or vision policy that the government has regarding this? How are we doing on the theoretical front of it ,as in what is the original research output that we are generating ? How does it compare to Intel and AMD cpus? What's your JEE score /s Following the Moore's always we will be reaching the current configurations of CPU's around 20 years from now OP ? Or shorter. But still this is amazing, I have seen the productions lines, and it seems hella crazy, so much precision, care and methods. Great Work !! Can it run Crysis? How is this different (or better) than other silicon based processors from silicon valley? I'm curious @prabot do you work at powai labs ? Will it still follow Moore's law ? :) Congratulations from IIT Kharagpur. Even though this is much slower than Industry standard processors around the world.  
I'm still proud of this achievement done in India. Hopefully our government will start funding more towards this. I'm not a technical guy, but, is there a possibility that the project can, sometime in future, be scaled up into a motherboard that can go into laptops made in India for Indian market? I'm sick of people always bragging about how electronics are cheaper overseas and the lengths to which people go to save $100 on their laptops by asking their overseas cousins to get mobiles and laptops for them. I'd really like to see laptops and other electronics developed in India and being cost-competitive with the rest of the world. All of the following question are on ELI5 level :

1.) Can you do a comparison of your processor and i3/i5 .

2.) Can processors be reverse engineered? how hard is to reverse engineer a processor.

3.) Who are the giants in the field of processors research/R&D.

4.) What are the key obstacles in the development of processors.

5.) What kind of equipments are needed to manufacture your product? are these machineries available/produced in india? what machineries are required to mass produce your product. Also, what's the cost of manufacturing your product (say 10,000 processor)

6.) why it took so many years for india to produce a processor while companies like intel is selling it to millions?

7.) I see in every few month a more developed processor is launched (i3 ----> i5 ----> i7)  why is that they couldn't able to produce the current version few months ago? how come they weren't able to produce it then but just after 6 months they can produce it now.

8.) What's the highest potential of current processor technology? 

9.) I have heard about quantum processors, are they the next generation of processors? how different is the quantum processor technology to the current processor technology?

10.) If you had a superconductor, what effect would you have on your processor/ or in the world of processor? What programming language did you the most? ARM? He's answered only 2 questions by my count and they were pretty softball ones. Pack it up boys. This is starting to look like the Arnoob Goswami AMA. Propaganda at its finest. I wonder if this processor even exists or if it's just another fabrication of the government propaganda? Heard that it is based on havard architecture instead of von Neumann. Why is that? [removed] I thought SHAKTI was India’s first microprocessor. Does it run `gcc`? Could you tell me why some of the brats from IIT are so arrogant? Bet it works as well as testicles in a pc Wow! Salute to the guy who made India proud! Does it have a toilet ? Kitna deti hai?? Why does India make it so hard to do business with other countries? Non tech guy here. Is this chip a mobile processor? I hope and believe if Indians would finally stop leaking their top talent to other countries and find a way to implore them to staying there. I feel extremely bad how all the incredible talent that our nation generates leaves and ends up fighting to find a way to find citizenship in an another country as opposed to leading our own to greatness. 

I am one of them and I feel ashamed of that fact every day.

Hopefully one day I can return and pride myself for being Indian.. 

#JAIHIND Can it run Crysis? Why would I want to use yours over lets say a core i9 or ryzen 7? Do you plan on competing with them in the kind of tasks they do? i.e. mainstream processing"

Sorry, 10/10 or no AMA :) 2001 feels like ages ago.. TIL: Parsees pray in 🔥 temples. Where did 0.25 of the marks go? I couldn't find anything wrong. You should have asked for re-eval. What Is The First Thing You Think Of When You Wake In The Morning? Is this GK or religious studies? Ahh the good old days. 3/4 lmao Nine and three quarters. 

Is this Indian Hogwarts? 9¾? But there no such thing as 9¾..is there? Try going into the paper and see if you end up in the Hogwarts train. 😁 .5 marks for Delhi instead of New Delhi ? I really liked how the paper was very secular , gave you information about somr major religions which most people I know don't know about Where are you now? It’s interesting that most of the questions are about religion. Why is the country obsessed with religion? You are one year senior to me. 

How's life, spyder? Nerd alert! India Father: Why couldn't you score 10/10? Sharmaji ke ladke se kuch seekhle.

and 

Delhi University: Better luck next time. 9 and 3/4. Well there is your ticket to Hogwarts Express. i wish our PM could have scored the same! 😶 That handwriting tho Yer a wizard, Harry! In question 2 with the options given, I'm reminded of a story told by my parents about me in first standard where I had a similar question with 5 parts and 5 options given. I apparently marked 4 of them correctly and left the fifth blank and when asked about it said that I didn't know the answer to the fifth one so that's why I left it. Bro yeh toh top kara paper hai,maths ka paper kaha hai ?

lol never heard of  a person getting 3/4 Shout out to a fellow Goan 👌 Fodrecha I was 1 year old when you attempted this paper :( But you got only 6½ marks Show-off!! Wow, where you from in Goa? Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of General Knowledge? Based on the 1st question you have answered, I'd like to ask you, what do you think should be done about the Kashmir issue. Not as an Indian, but as a humanitarian. What's the name of this school ? How did  you prepare for the exam saar?All india rank must be 200-300 mein. Sharmaji ke bete ko poore 10 mile thhe does 3/4th exist today? Bois.... How come teacher give Delhi as right answer it must be New Delhi. Did you used to impress teacher like we all do to become class monitor 😂😂 Was your GK sir a Kar Sevak ? Capital of India is New Delhi technically. Also please give your location - it should be North India. North of India makes it look at if Kashmir is a separate entity from India. Being an Atheist it sucks to see how religion is fed into a kid's brain before they learn science and stuff... This prevents them from questioning their religion."
AMA,AMA Request: A Kashmiri Pandit over 30 years old.,75,cnhzlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnhzlf/ama_request_a_kashmiri_pandit_over_30_years_old/,73,"Now that 370 and 35A have been abolished, a few questions:

1. How do you perceive the Law and Order situation to evolve over the short term?

2. What are your expectations regarding returning to Kashmir?

3. Do you wish to return back to your ancestral house?

4. Would you be willing to pay back all the facilities that have been provided to you by the government for the past 30 years? For example, would you be willing to give up the housing that you got if you get your old house back?

5. Should reservation for Kashmiri Pandits be withdrawn now?",contraryview," I know one but he's 20. I'll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit

His entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: 

""Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.""

Also he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read ""Our moon has blood clots"" Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  
I will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :

""I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch."" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:

My parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. 

Unfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of ""patriotism"" and ""unification"" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. 

The most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.

1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?
2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. 
3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won't return because we'll never feel safe. 
4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you're asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren't moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. 
5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.

I am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).

Frankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren't enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn't consider ""our plight""

Policy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago, but now it's too late. Without internet and swarm of Bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit. I think I can see if no one turns up.

I am a proud Indian and love my country, however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues. It has been highly stressful psychologically as well.

I wanted to share this experience that I endured for a year and the troubles we both faced in the light of modern politics and peoples mindsets. To give you some background: I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. Go ahead, ask me anything!",muaazkhn," So, reverse Sania Mirza!

Congrats! Which side has better Biryani? Also congratulations op! Who will your kids support during Ind vs Pak?
**Congratulations anyway** I just want to congratulate you! Wish you a very happy married life!! Name you're kid Kashmir. Do play Lahore by Guru Randhawa on your wedding if you can. It would be fun. [deleted] Wow, British are finally making amends! Congrats op! How hot are her friends man? Please seek blessings from Mudikaka. What were your parents reaction when you told the about the marriage? 
Also, what religion will you be teaching your children if at all you want to. Unless you plan to stay internationally you're bound to face huge problems in bringing her to India and her going back to Pakistan for visits etc.given the tense situation which can blow up anytime into a war like one.

How'd you plan to handle it? Congratulations! Punjaban, good luck man. What did her parents and relatives have to say about the arrangement? Congratulations man! God bless you both! Dating a Pakistani was fun when I was in London, but I wouldn’t have had the balls to marry one. Kudos!

Just remember one thing, even if you guys end up getting British citizenship, Indian govt for the purpose of immigration when you enter the country won’t allow her a visa on arrival that other Brit citizens are eligible for since she would be an ex-Pakistani citizen. 

However, that is atleast about 7 years away, so meanwhile she would be getting these short term visas. And by short term I’m talking in days and not months. Max my Pakistani friend who got married to an Indian from WB has gotten is 45 days. He is a  green card holder, she has American passport with PIO. 

Don’t let these small irritants deter you from celebrating the glory of your marriage. 

God bless you two again! Congrats!

Do both of u plan on changing your citizenship to become UK citizens?

Also which university did both of u go to?😂 Are you planning to introduce your wife to some nice Idly/Chutney from SLV and Masala Dosa from CTR? was she da bomb though? (no offense xd) Congratulations dude!

Are you a UK citizen ? If not are you hopeful of getting citizenship. Better settle there mate, things will be pretty bad in case you have to go back home. 

Are your parents questioned by  relatives/neighbors about this entire episode or they have kept it hidden so far. Are you Muslim?

&#x200B;

Out of curiosity

&#x200B;

\>however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues

&#x200B;

is this due to political differences between india/pak ie nationalism (If so more from pakistan side or indian side)? Or are there significant cultural differences causing this?

&#x200B;

Also what kind of cultural differences have u faced in dating her? Good for you & her. Congrats. Benglur ke musalmaana ka naam roshan karreen bhai. Harrow or Newham? Where are you guys getting married? Are we invited? >  I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both  met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. 

Stay in London. Your future wife is also dong an AMA? If not, asl her abd sharethr link too So what’s the marriage called ? Samjhauta Express ? I don't believe you. Better send me an invitation and allow me to check the food counter to verify if they are authentic Indian or Pakistan cuisine. 



XD. Congrats OP! You are very wholesome person OP.... 

Also when you go to Lahore make sure you know the location of all handpumps  :P When you are getting married don't bring a cat/kitten in a basket :p I wonder what would've happened if you belonged to some other religion. Hey, congrats man!

Since the time you met her, how have your perceptions about Pakistan or her about India changed? Please send pics of food. Thanks. Congratulations. Do you think more relationships like this may ease the tension between the two countries? I read that you're planning to settle in London and register the marriage there. Did you get married in India and then request to get the marriage registered in London?

Also are you from London and will be sponsoring her as a dependent? Omg this is so cute man, who made the first move? Ok.. What are the real problem that you faced?
Like visa or permissions for marriage etc? To aaj se tum bhi anti-nashnul /s

He said this to me ""aadha amrican aur adha indian to thah, phir bewi ney lar kar aur adha indian kar diya. this is one of the most wholesome threads ever. I had a friend in Melbourne, Punjabi Sikh who had married a Pakistani Muslim girl who was Australian born and brought up. Neither of the families raised any issue since they were not residing in India. Can't imagine how that would've turned had they been  residents back home. Congrats man. Though apparently its not unheard of for Indian origin and Pakistani origin people to marry in UK, especially among muslims. It's all one big desi community once you leave your home country. Once you settle in there, no one will bother you. Have fun. Weird flex, but ok^/s Congratulations sir :)

Just curious, if you have discussed this, was there any difference in how India/Pak's historical events were perceived by her and by you. Might be interesting to know how much of the information passed on to us in our/their history books/media is correct or not. Congratulations.
Have you visited Pakistan to visit her fam? Or did your girl's family visit you and your fam in India? 
Where do you plan to get married? I already see too many visa problems either way. 
All the best for your life, Pakistani women are very beautiful :) Tennis wali sania Dulha khojal Pakistani Invite me to your marriage pleassseeeee. I LOVE BIRYANI and would enjoy the culture as well. For me its a bit more complicated. I am a brahmin, but we are ready for the challenges lying ahead!! all the best to you. Was religion a big factor? I'm assuming you follow Islam because of your username. If so, did it help in any way? Are you planning to stay in London or will you move to India/Pakistan?

Also, how is your family being treated if they live in India? Are you going to live In India or Pakistan after that? Congrats man. Wishing you guys a lifetime of love and happiness. 👍🏻👍🏻 so are you from westminster/ lse ? Congrats buddy!
Hope it doesn't rain during this Indo-Pak match.
(And both sides win) What job do you both do in London? Its honestly not that uncommon especially amongst NRIs. Dont think a single czn of mine married an Indian now that I think of it Where do you plan on staying after wedding Where are you guys planning on getting married ? 

How did you guys meet ?

Where are you planning to live after marriage ?

Sorry if these seem to personal, just curious. Wo RAZZI kese ho gayi??? >At university, she was the head of a student union society, I ended up joining that society and asked her if she wants to go out with me.

Guess u were the white guy for an Indian her /s


And Congratulations bud....Happy married life I see you are Indian citizen. What are you going to do in case you have to leave the UK? How will you manage your relationship then? deleted Apart from the hell you will be facing when trying to visit India with your wife will you be getting British Passport anytime soon for yourself and your wife and future kids ? If you ever have an argument with any of her relatives regarding India Pakistan, make sure to stand up aggressively and say this

> ""I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

2. What was the learning curve involved.
How did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?
2. How many days of the year you work in one year?
3. How many hours you spend per day? How much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? So that one can live off the profits and doesn't need to do other jobs to earn a living. What’s your basic strategy - Momentum trading , special situations ? Also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio. 

Congrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it ! Congratulations. wow! do you recommend any book a beginner can get. 1. Do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? 
2. Whats your average trade size? Like, how many RIL shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?
3. which sectors are your favourite? I burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock Biggest loss amount? What are your most common trading instruments? Do you think mutual funds is a good investment strategy ? Between real estate and mutual funds which would you pick ? do you trade as an individual or have you set up an LLC or something?  Can you spill some secrets on how to win in intraday? I’ve made a few thousands trading but mostly I am holding long because I can’t win consistently in intraday. What strategy should I use? Also, which TA tool is the best? I personally use only BB, RSI and MACD. What would you recommend to a person who wants to get into it and maybe pursue trading as a side business while studying? How much tax have you paid on the CG? ever get stuck with an intraday short you could not cover by EOD? What's your age and when did you started intraday trading? I don't want you to dispense any misconceptions my way. I've enough of my own, thanks. [deleted] Can you give a short introduction on how to start trading and where to start, what books to read, sites you recommend and scams to avoid, for a noob like me. I don’t understand leverage in stock market did you use technical analysis?
if not, please describe your strategy. I dont have any spare money.

How can I get started with this? Intra day trader! I actually don’t believe in technicals, charts don’t work. That’s why most of the intra day traders don’t make it. But the people look at the candles and what not and still make money. May be it works but I just can’t bring myself to believe it does. Congrats to you though for making lots of money! Congrats Would you do an AMA after you lose your money too? I want to start trading too, what are the formal procedures(bank accounts etc) to get started and how to choose a broker.
Also suggest the simplest way to get started Few questions : 
a) What percentage of your trade are Intraday ? 
b) How long on an average are your non intraday trades ?
c) if there are 10 metrics you measure for making a buy/sell call what are those ? would love to know some of the statistics on your trades. especially win/loss ratio, number of trades. I am en engineer by profession and would like to explore the world of trading. I have absolutely 0 knowledge on the subject. I just read you recommending Rupee tales by Zerodha. Any Youtube channels instead? Thanks for the AMA. I have always looked down upon trading as everyone I know lost their money in the market (my dad, my mama etc). I am in a comfortable place in IT right now and I can take a bit of the risk with my money. Please know that I know absolutely nothing about trading.

I see you recommend zerodha varsity. But the question is, can one start with capital as small as 1 lakh? Just to test the waters? Would you recommend intraday trading for a guy with a regular 9 - 5 job? I feel there are two knowledge components: one is understanding the technical stuff like what is a short. 

The other part is following the industry - daily news and analysis which allows you to make informed decisions. What sources do you recommend for this?

What is your view on Zerodha smallcases? I don't have the time to trade intraday. Is it viable to make money through swing trading over a few days? Kind of a stupid question. Which brokerage firm do you use for trading? Who provides the best online platform for trading in India? WoW. Congrats Manu vai. Have you tried your hand at CryptoCurrency trading? Or at least ever held any Crypto? When should a person start investing and how much of his income should he invest and where to get decent profits and stable passive income. I am a beginner and am interested in concept of dividend funds, are they helpful in the long run? How you do you differentiate between a pull back and a reversal? Which technique do you rely on?
Technical, fundamental or quantitative? [deleted] 1. Do you stay alone? Or with your parents?
2. If you live with family, what do they think of your work? Do you have your setup in a room?
3. Do you sell naked OTM puts? So I am someone with high risk appetite and have a few lacs that I want to invest (or rather I want to experiment with). But I don't want to do intraday trading full time, so what goals should I set myself? Also, do you mainly invest on stocks or do you bet on macroeconomic aspects as well? For professionals who dont have time but still want to have a investment going in stocks ,what would be your best advice...?
Also how much return should i realistically be looking for.
I have few investments with bluechip and as per their advice ,have invested in few mutual funds.
Should i do anything differently.? If I can spare a decent amount of capital, what would you recommend as my starting reading material? 

In no hurry to make quick money 1) Which software you are using?
2) How many people you have hired?
3) How you keep check on greed and need of your investment?
4) what are the major complications in this business? I'm not 18 legally. But I started trading through my father this year. I turned 10K to 13.5K in March when I started, then bought ALBK. My father said I'm making too many trades. So I'm waiting till August to invest via my own account. I have a few questions, and anybody can answer them:

1. How do I invest 10K? There is no way I can increase my capital or whatever 10K is. I really want to trade and learn the craft.

2. Which online broker should I use?

3. How do I stay on top of the news? Wanted to understand about your technique. These signals that you talk about, they automatically which means you are using an API? Which brokers provide a good set. Also, any of them provide intraday volumes as well along with price? Investing is mostly going against the tide (buy stocks with bearish sentiments) whereas trading is going with the tide (follow market sentiments).  
How much do you agree with the above statement? So you are telling us all you had more than 200% annualised returns thats more than 2 bps per trade on average assuming you made fewer than 10,000 trades(Thats is an already an absurdly large number of trades)!!! Wow!!!

That is so unbelievable I don't even believe you :/

But hey man fair play to you if its true. I think you would be among the most successful trader of all time. Do you believe in technical analysis? Especially in intraday trading. Hi Manu, I am regular 24 year old with a job that doesn't allow me to day trade. However, i'd still like to get started with investing: trading, funds and other financial instruments to supplement my income. Where can I start? Are there any courses you would suggest?

I do not mind paying for training on how to invest. I only ask that it fits into my lifestyle, and doesn't require me to invest multiple hours at end. Hey man, late to the party. NRI swing trader here and what you're doing is beyond my ultimate dream so I have a few questions for you.

1. Did you test your strategies on international markets (like on demo accounts). I'm curious if it's work on NASDAQ and NYSE

2. Do you place both long and short positions or just long?

3. It's a very bullish market. If I had invested in almost any tech stock a year ago, I'd have doubled my money. What makes your strategy stand out?

5. Did your position size get bigger as your account grew or did you always trade with same size.

4. Any tips to make 2% a week? just couple days ago was thinking about you wondering where are you right now. and bamm here you are. Would you say that to trade successfully it needs to be a full-time job? Meaning someone occupied 10 hours every day in another job can't possibly spare the time to learn the right information. This is some WSB level shit. You are quoting 30% returns as predictable in your comments. It’s all fun and games when we are in a 10 year bull market but I feel bad for the idiots who’re going try this and lose everything!

Yeah I made a killing betting on tech stocks over the past two years but I’m not stupid enough to claim my intelligence had anything to do with it. I'm not from a business/engineering background. Got no idea about trading but know that starting early is better. I'm already in my early 20s. What do I do? How do I start investing with minimal income? What will be your advice to someone who doesn't know anything about trading but wants to make money of it. How do I start? Hey congrats question do you keep tight Stop-loss for your strategy means in terms of profit in percent how much is your stop-loss for each trade? Have you ever thought increasing capital impacts return of your strategy due to slippage? What was the purpose of this AMA? You didn't dispense any misconceptions about trading. Whatever you have answered is completely useless or something people can ""GOOGLE"". Most of the things you said, you have said in a vague manner. People ask you for guidance regarding materials to study, some sort of structure, and you say ""ZERODHA VARSITY"" in every single answer - like you're promoting Zerodha. Everyone knows Zerodha will fuck you up one day or another. You haven't gone into detail in any of the answers, every answer is vague, useless, and unhelpful. And on top of this, you ask people to ""GOOGLE"" stuff as if they don't know.

It looks like the sole purpose of this ama and the one before this was to show off. You haven't dispensed anything, you haven't helped anyone through these two amas. Almost all the things you have said in a vague manner, most people know. This ama is like a ""fuck you mediocre people, look at me - i made 1 crore+ with 30L capital"".

Now, that guy is frickin useful and down to earth and is properly giving useful information and putting people on a path/direction. You are useless dude. 244 comments and all I can see is Zerodha Varsity. You don't have to discuss your strategies, but what the heck are you gonna lose by discussing the top books that you have read which helped, or the step by step procedure for system building, the challenges you have faced, the journey you have taken as a trader, etc. You say you have been trading for 10+ years on and off, and yet you don't even discuss your early years, how they shaped you, etc. This was a totally stupid ama. Hello friend. I am learning for investing into stock I am learning by watching youtube videos. Can you guide what would be a better way to learn more into investing stocks? Background: I used to work for a large hedge fund in a technology role. The hedge fund employed quantitative strategies in addition to a large array of research analysts.

I have been trading on my own for more than a year. I have had some great profits, and great losses.

I wrote this for all those who think they can make quick money in the market by choosing a security and choosing a time and direction. Listen up.

You are an uninformed trader. You do not have any special information about the future which is not also available to the professionals.

All ""easy"" informed trading is done almost immediately by computers. An example is: stock A is at $10. There is new information which is clearly bullish. Within a second, the stock will be at $12. The new price reflects the new information. You cannot beat the computers at informed trading.

New ""complex"" information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be trade-worthy. You can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training, tools and access to insiders. That doesn't mean all analysts are right or in agreement, but only that their opinion is more informed than yours. Again, you cannot hope to profit using analysis of ""complex"" information if the market doesn't agree with you. Reading a Seeking Alpha article (and the comments) is not analysis.

After the information is priced in, any further price movement is driven by supply-demand and not by new information. You cannot guess at supply-demand. It happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders. I laugh at people who buy $TWTR AFTER getting the information that Jack Dorsey also bought some last week. There may be a sentiment rally if others start buying, there may not be. You really don't know.

Charting is useful only in hindsight. Prior price/volume action has no bearing on future price/volume action. You say pivot points? Let us say SPY is reaching 237.00 from above. Everybody says it is an important ""support"". What does that mean? Will it break that support or not? If it breaks, will it go much lower, or bounce back up to reclaim the support? Again, you don't know. Today SPY broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down. Which break-down is definitive? It is only clear in hindsight.

Now, all the above should make it clear that, in essence, you are an uninformed trader, that is, you are trading blind. That means, charitably speaking, that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 50-50.

But still you will lose. There are two reasons for this. One relates to the way trades happen, and other is about human psychology.

(a) If you place a limit buy or limit sell, your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you. 
  That is, if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price, your buy order will execute. And if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price, your sell order will execute. In each case (unless you are closing a trade), you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement.

( If the price is not moving much, you are immediately at a loss due to the bid/ask spread.  And you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it.  More often than not, price movement continues in the same direction.  Reversals are rare and hard to time.)

This means, that

(b) You immediately are in pain. You see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continues.

Now you have many options:

i) You can exit the trade at a loss. Bummer.

ii) You can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price. This again suffers from the same problem. The price is moving away from you while all your orders execute. Your new trade is as uninformed as the last one.

iii) You can hold the bag, ""hoping"" for a reversal.

Both in (ii) and (iii), you are now holding the bag.

Let us talk about that.

Usually, the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder. You regret the trade. You are stressed. You have averaged it 3, maybe 4 times already. You want to at least exit at break-even.

Therefore, as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit, you will itch to book the profit and relax. Hence, you will make the all-too-common (but understandable) trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners. After the trade shows some green, because you have experienced the red, you will be afraid that it will again go red. You will be wanting to not go through that pain again.

Therefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss % of 20 or even 50, but you will never see that kind of profit %. Ever. You would have booked the profit at 2% or 5%.

So what's the consequence? Even assuming each trade has a 50-50 chance of going your way, your losses will always be bigger than your winners.

Eventually, you will curse trading and seek gainful employment.

Hope it was helpful.

 What about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into ""momentum""? This can work, some of the time.  How do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after?  But the main problem is the stops.  If you have a tight stop, volatility will take you out.  If you have a wide stop, your loss will be wide too.  Figuring out a proper stop based on ""pivot points"" and past realized volatility is not that straightforward, but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too.

I still trade, but am a more humble trader after the experiences.  It is possible to develop an edge, but it takes specialized skills and hard work.

TL;DR: If you don't have a well-defined edge, you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term. Saar job milegi? When will you get a real job? [deleted]"

AMA.",179,bgsh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgsh11/im_a_16lpm_elite_mba_who_cant_find_a_job_ama/,238,I graduated from one of the best b-schools of India. I did fairly well (top 20% of my batch) and got a good placement. But the company went bankrupt after 2 years. I've been looking for a new job for the last 3 months but haven't been able to find anything.,evilbombadil," A lot of times companies just don't process your resume after looking at your previous salary. This has been very apparent in software professionals who switched to a software job in a financial institution (jpmc, Nomura etc) and then left it. Is 1.6 lakh a decent salary for an elite MBA grad? Do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? Hah 3 months is rich, took.me 6 to even get a job..... 

Hold tight man , it will come. Did you take education loan, if yes then how much, if no then what was your total kharcha for the MBA? As someone who is doing a job after BBA and is stuck between doing Papa ka business or making a career by myself. Is MBA worth the 20-30L of investment? I am 33 year old planning to do 1 year MBA from IIM A/B/C/L or XLRI. I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. 

Reason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.

Should I do MBA ? 

Keep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you're earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn't that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It's been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you're also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn't last too much though).  
   
Btw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?
I may be able to refer you if something matches. will you work in a company that would pay 20%-30% less than your previous pay? Among HR, marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? Was the company a startup? Campus placement? Can relate to this situation. Hope you land a good job!   
Incase you are looking for some leads, do DM. We are hiring in my team. Need good finance knowledge. How/Why did your company go bankrupt? At what age did you get your job at 1.4 lakhs pm ? What was your CAT %ile/GMAT? (Optional :P)

Do you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting/IB etc. ?

Does your academic history before MBA matter much after MBA? Why did it fail? And what do you think the founders/management could have done differently to save it? What would have you done? 

Also, is the product still 'out there'? I feel joy in reviving past/broken/failed products, if only money was a constraint. alumni help nahi karta ? [deleted] Bhai, when i read your story, I had to check whether I had posted it myself. Only difference is I was fired for factors within and without my control. I had taken this unemployment thing a bit lightly - my company gave me three months time to find another job. The first month went with a flurry of interview from good companies - flunked them all since I was under prepared and tensed.
The second month, I took a step back, started reading and playing PUBG. I am now in the third month and have recently started applying. You situation seems to have added a sense of urgency now and thank you for that. I am currently not too worked up since I have the finances to pay off the loan and live unemployed for quite a few months at home.

However the prospect of continued unemployment is now looking a bit worrisome. I have started working on constructive habits such as waking up at 6:00 AM, meditating, exercising - key habits that have let me down in the past and hopefully will help me in the future. I am more concerned how my parents will react  - I haven't told them yet. 

Any help in this regard will very helpful. It's unclear if you ""can't find a job"" because of being picky about offers or because you haven't gotten an offer.   
Either way, your asset is the network, not the degree. Check your college email ID for job leads. Post on your alumni telegram and whatsapp groups, preferably also the city group and not only the batch group. And spend less time on reddit till this is over.  


Source: Am a 1.6lpm ""elite"" MBA who can find a job any week of the month 1.6lpm on paper or in hand? 

Any previous experience prior to MBA? 
MBA in what? 

PM me your resume, will refer in my company if I like it. Salary shouldn't be a problem if you are good. First of all sorry for your situation. Have you tried working in start ups for stocks rather than huge salary? The reason I am asking this is because, I am from a similar B school and initially I worked in a small start up for gaining experience. With just a 5 minute video, I want you to help me understand with real examples about what you studied in MBA and what type of things you do on job.

Because a lot of people say ""Bro become a software developer they earn 2.3lpm"" but very few people talk about the annoying and nerdy codes they write for hours. What about job referrals through buddies? Beyond a point depending on recruiters doesnt make sense... especially if you are in 1.6lpa bracket. Dear OP,
Please tell me which area of business you want to work in - Ops, Analytics, HR, Finance or Strategy. If you wish it so, I can help you with a referral at my current org, provided there are matching opportunities and you are also similarly inclined.
Thanks. Get to Bangalore, make a list of 50 companies and walk into their offices with a flower bouquet and 2 senior contact names. Ask to meet them and ask for a job.

&#x200B;

Two companies per day and in four weeks, you will have atleast a dozen leads. Is your salary expectation a factor? Are you Lord of the rings fan? What did you major in before your MBA? I hope you won't mind answering 

I am doing btech rn in a relatively new field (biotechnology) I have absolutely no interest in research and would like to get into a corporate job.
How exactly should I plan my career?
I am planning on finishing my degree, get a job, leave it after a year or two and get an MBA and get back to the corporate world.

Also, have you tried getting a job abroad? Hey Bro! There are lots of referral groups on WhatsApp and other social media for Top MBA college students. You can try subscribing to those. A lot of my friends having your mentioned salary switched jobs using these groups. Okay. Prepared for the down-votes so here goes. Sorry bout your situation, but this is only the start of an epidemic. Our gen needs to wake up from this MBA gold rush. Working as an AI programmer, I can bet my balls this is a trend that will grow exponentially in the coming years.

Management is a dead industry. Why? Cause A.I! Management is part of occupations that you can  term 'pseudo-expertise'. When a $12/month EC2 cluster can be trained to make the same decisions as you why would I expend 40L/year? That's just reality and the sooner we get with it the better.

**Free advice the you're probably not gonna take:**
Stash that IIM MBA in dadaji's peti, learn some basic programming and get an advanced degree in Analytics.

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Don't need to verify OP,  I have faith on my looks! Fun fact: This is the 5th year of the Mark My Words Thread!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I predict 5 more. Alright. Before next Diwali, I will get out of the rut I'm in. 

Get my degree. Get in shape. Lose my virginity. Read some books. Get fluent in French. Get a decent job. 

I'm serious this time. 

Remind me! November 13th, 2020 Abhi guitar 🎸 mujhe baja raha hai, tab mai guitar bajaunga. A resurgence in ""hindsight is 20/20"" type jokes. India will win >5 golds in Tokyo. I'll attend in person. I Will get one match on Tinder I would have definitely mastered the art of driving by next year Diwali, at least I hope I do. My digital marketing firm would be bigger than what it is right now and I'd get to buy/rent an office space I'll lose atleast 10kgs of weight. I would lose 15 more kilos. Would prolly work at my own or some friend's startup. I will still have no girlfriend Oxeam3 will not lose his virginity - Mark my words till 2025. I will get a job and a girlfriend next year I predict there well be at least as many false prediction as last year.

(only me so surprised so less predictions was actually true ? xD) By next Diwali, 


I will get an Internship at a good product based company or startup.


I will become a badass bald guy with an upper body like Frank Medrano's and legs like Ronaldo's. Katega I will either switch job or start preparing for UPSC


Rohit Sharma will become Indian Cricket Team's captain


Tik tok users will surpass WhatsApp users TATA will be most affected company due to economic slowdown, might decide to shut down since segments of Tata Motors.      
       
Amazon/Flipkart will be under radar of govt. Thanks to Mota Bhai, bcoz Reliance will launch e-commerce platform.     
       
Saurav Ganguly will join BJP.      
      
NRC purview will increase to multiple states. ""AAP will win Delhi 2020 election""
But I'm a NOTA supporters I'll get 99+ %ile in CAT in the coming year. Mark my words. Mark my word for 2020 -

* ""India will be superpower in 2020"" as predicted by our lovely ex-president APJ Abdul Kalam Sir. We are successfully failed in it.
2. India will make good efforts to promote electric vehicles and in green energy field.
3. Jio will start exploiting users like Airtel and Vodafone.
4. Recession will hit hard.
5. Government will close down or create problems in major PSUs.
6. MS Dhoni will retire from Cricket. I will become the main subject of a conspiracy theory. Going to get a much needed surgery.  
  
I'm going to finally move out of my parents home and get a job that's better than any of my batchmates. I'll hit the gym from next month and gain 10 Kgs. I won’t see Diwali 2020. Just a feeling.... I will do sincere efforts to improve my life I will be same next year.. Big Fat Bald Loser.. Rupee will hit new low of 85 to 1$ Priyanka chopra and nick whoever breaking up next year India will lift the WT20 2020.

I will finally get a decent job with good pay for sure.

I will fulfill my family's dreams. I will kill myself finally * Digital rights go further down the toilet, with blatant abuse of laws to ban whatever the government doesn’t want us talking about. 

* An marked shift towards Russian/Chinese style of surveillance; an attack on the intelligentsia. The government will manufacture excuses to extract details of donors to organisations/think tanks that oppose the national dialogue

* The blur between advertorials and actual news becomes so fine that people are exposed to propaganda non stop and don’t know it. This leads to an increased level of background casual racism that becomes more and more accepted. 

* BJP goes after opposition via Tax Man and the opposition eats itself like the fox from the Antichrist film and there is nothing left to oppose Modi-Shah

* Modi’s star wanes while Shahs rises. There is no major power struggle, but the writing becomes clear on the wall. 

* Water scarcity problem becomes dire and erratic weather wreaks havoc state by state, month by month. People become desensitised to the madness and uninstall PhonePe when it suggests for the umpteenth time to donate to CM flood disaster fund. 

* Internationally, nations become stricter with their immigration processes and increasing competition makes economic migration near impossible. Brain drain decreases, but in a market where cow piss research has more funding from Centre than biotech research, they are unable to contribute in a meaningful manner. 

* Amitabh Bachan dies. 

* I come out of the closet to my family, but they assume something is wrong with me. 

* Everything must burn in order to rise from the ashes. I will become superfit and get an arm tattoo. Definitely! Reduction in use of plastic and reduction in pollution. I will have a girlfriend (hope she says yes mah dudes) 

I will finally stop procrastinating and start studying again and get back my form

I will overcome my illness 

I will finally stop highlighting every sentence of my book because I don’t get what I’m reading. (Most important of all) I'll be doing an internship in summer 2020 and will have a job by Diwali 2020.

Good enough situation for PS5 I will get a job offer.       
I will learn French, at least this year properly.      
Récession will hit and it will hit hard. Will finally get serious about UPSC,  would have forgotten about Priyanka (or back with her). By next Diwali, I will have figured out this adulting business. I'll also have made up my mind about which path to take: MS in US, In India via GATE, or work at a top product co. in India. BJP won't lose any election except maybe in Delhi. They'll just show some ""slightly poor"" performances to convince people the elections aren't rigged.  I will overcome my 13 year old addition (I am tired of it). I will be  getting six packs. I will change atleast one Indian's life. I will learn  3 new things! [deleted] I will get a partner by Diwali 2020 More banks will fail. Get abs and build my legs stronger... I want to travel abroad, probably to Japan. But before that, I need a better career and need to resist the 'get married"" pressure from the family. Agle saal bhi lagra hai Single hi rahunga.

AMA,Requesting AMA by Residents of Jammu & Kashmir.,6,crofzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crofzs/requesting_ama_by_residents_of_jammu_kashmir/,16,"If there is any Residents of Jammu & Kashmir, Requesting to hold a AMA. It will help us to know perception and situation from your eyes.",namanjha29," [deleted] Perception of majority is that they want fee Kashmir, but what they always fail to answer is about what will they do after freedom and what will be policy and laws given that 3 nuclear countries live next to you.
Just because you ‘want’ freedom doesn’t mean u get it without proper basic policies There is already an AMA done last week"
AMA,Before and after my Opti-LASIK procedure in Bangalore. Right eye -4 sph and -2.50 cyl. Left eye -5 sph and -2.25 cyl. AMA,174,bae2ym,https://i.redd.it/auysrkb2ssq21.jpg,311,,_hein_," Is the blue mask free or did you pay extra for it?  I think people r not asking the important questions..
How many fingers am i holding up? ✌ How is the result? Any irritation in eye? Did anyone care about who you were before you put on the mask? [deleted]  glasses gone Swag mode on 😁 What did the doctor say about the long term effects ? I'm too thinking of doing LASIK but I've heard in most cases eye sight gets dull again after a few years. Thanks for posting, this has been very informative for someone planning on getting lasik. lasik se tum gori ho gayi ho..

&#x200B;

/s [deleted] I got this procedure done 3 years ago. AMA Can cylindrical correction be fixed via Lasik? How does it feel being a girl on r/india ?  How many DMs you have got till now? Did your office cover it? Or personal expense? How much vision did you get back. ?

I got 90% back.

&#x200B; Has this boosted your confidence? And do people act differently around you since you no longer wear glasses?  How many years did you wear glasses for? It sounds weird but I've worn glasses for half my life and I feel like it'll be weird to get used to not having them (though I'd love to not be dependent on them all the time) Do you think not having glasses now has changed your personality in some ways? I got mine done in 2013, I wonder how much has changed since then. I have the same power. Can you give me your specs? lol my brother got a lasik recently, now he is the hot one. So you got your surgery done and doctors advised to avoid screen exposure and here you are hosting AMA. Good god, lady, go and sleep. LASIK gang hi5. Got it done 3yrs back. Was -6.

Also, I got cooler shades after the procedure. Huh!  Exact procedure name? 

Hospital?

Total cost?

Totally corrected or you still need glasses? [deleted] What is the cost of the treatment?  Why do you look more excited before surgery than after it though? Btw was your vision stable for a few years? How long did the full procedure take? Is LASIK risk free?  I get anxiety thinking I might lose my sight. Did insurance cover your surgery? How have you adjusted to your non glasses look? Did you asked your doctor about PRK? If so did he recommended it? Damn. I feel like a retard. People are asking question while I'm scratching my head because I didn't understand the post itself Did you have astigmatism? I’d like to correct my vision, but apparently I’m not a good candidate because of astigmatism.   Getting lasik done was one of the best decision of my life. it's been five years now. Having thick specs throughout school added to my introversion and social anxiety and kind of made me waste a lot of years under insecurities. after lasik, being active was easier, not needing to pick up glasses first thing in morning was a big big freedom. somehow it helped me become a better person. I won't say I'm completely free of social anxiety but with better confidence its easier to handle life.  

Today I and everyone have forgotten that I ever wore glasses. I don't have any photo from my school life.  but every once in while I still think about the freedom lasik got me and I feel grateful for being able to see clearly.

Enjoy the freedom and take care of your eyes.  Just when I thought of getting LASIK done, this AMA comes up. Good thing to be honest. I'm trying to get  Contoura Vision Eye Surgery which also is a type of LASIK. My question is how many days did the doctor advice you to not look directly at the sun or any bright objects? I mean how many days after you can return to your normal life style, job, using computer etc.? Opti-Lasik made you cool ..will hit on right girl for sure I am 17 with -7.2 vision. Reading this thread is a huge relief. Thank you. It's cool that the doctors changed ur dress and pumped some protein in u for no extra cost AMA? 

PM me your phone number.  Don’t mean to be rude but what’s the point of this? Why is their a advertisement in that washroom?
Is that your office or what?  Is their any risk? 

On the side note, how did you manage to be so skinny?  How long has your prescription been stable? I think I have similar power and was looking at Lasik, did they inform you of the risks? If the surgery goes wrong, do you just go blind? Your top matches you bag/jacket or whatever it is you’re holding or it’s just a dirty mirror? :P Hey! my girlfriend is planning to get it done, I am a little bit concerned about it. Is there anything she must know about the procedure, apart from the usual that you can't be out for a month?  Is there a minimum power for which the surgery takes place? How old are you?what's minimum age requirement? Hi, how much time does it require to recover
I am planning for one, but will have work commitments  Which phone is that?  Can you also tell us what was your power last year and a year before last year? 

I wanted to get LASIK done to my eyes this year, my power was constant for last 2-3 years and just this year it decreased to -4.5 from -5. Doctor said to wait for one more year.  Total cost and recovery time? So, for how long you will be away from work??  I can't tell the difference in your eyes, though I do notice that you're wearing completely different clothing, different eye piece, changed hair style, are now wearing a backpack. What am I missing ? Is there any age limit/barrier to get this done? is it worth it?  I envy people who can get LASIK done. I’ve been waiting for a decade till I would turn 18 and when I did I was told that there’s risk that my retina might get detached again. Well I guess I’ll have to stick to contacts and specs for the rest of my life.  why Lasik why not SMILE eye surgery? I see most of your comments were 2 hours ago, so you'll probably not reply. Anyway. 

How do you avoid eye strain post surgery, seeing as screens are everywhere and I'm assuming you didn't take a vacation or a 'tech cleanse'(?)...?

Also, what's the best place to get some parathas in Bangalore.? what was the cost of opreation?? You became a Badass!
 Nice. Do you know if someone with higher order aberrations in their vision can get corrective surgery? Mine is -3 cyl left eye.. I was advised not to go for LASIK as my cyl power is high.. I am optimistic now looking at you . Someday! How much did it cost ? u/_hein_ ok i have some similar doubts, i also reside in Bangalore, do you have astigmatism on your left eye?, if so, is it in just one eye? 

i can see vertical double vision with just one eye closed on my right, meaning even if i close my left eye, it doesnt matter i can still see double, TEXT and right below it a shadow TEXT, i wanted to know if you also have the same problem and if did LASIK solve it, because i can't read properly as night arrives and can't read text on dark backgrounds, can't drive at nights as i can see everything twice from lights on street to vehicles that it gets annoying to drive at all at night.  So what are we suppose to do, look into her eyes? was the anesthesia  local or generalised? [deleted] Only one question. Why the AMA?  kiran rao? That neck though. Nobody fucking cares, go back to FB . 

Also, where's the proof, all I see is a selfie attagirl. you look big on the right(!)

I too had a LASIK 3 years back. Do follow 30-30-30 rule & keep your eyes moist! 

 which one is before pic. It seems like before you were working in the office and after you got ready to party. What happens to your front hair? Laser ghumaye diye jyada.  Irrelevant comment-

AMA,I am an officer of the Indian Navy. AMA.,24,c26jef,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c26jef/i_am_an_officer_of_the_indian_navy_ama/,48,"I am a serving officer of the Indian Navy. In recent times I have realised that a lot of civilians do not know much about the Navy (apart from trash fed by news channels and movies) and have decided to do a short AMA to answer your questions. Would love to talk about the role of the Navy and the life of Armed Forces personnel.

Any answers are my personal opinion and do not represent the entire service.

Using a throwaway and not giving personal details for reasons of anonymity.",IndNavOffr," What civilian misconceptions/generalizations about life in the forces do you find most cringeworthy? What does the average day of a navy officer look like? How true are the stories of swinging culture in our forces? Are nuclear submarines almost non detectable?

How and from where to learn to tie them knots?

What level of corruption could be there in buying naval vessels from different countries? What is a traditional favourite food on Indian Naval vessels ? Can you talk more about food in the navy Have you ever been on board a destroyer? Have you ever commanded an entire vessel? Have you ever fired the guns on board a vessel? How do you guys(gentlemen) resist the urge to 'hawai-fire' on diwali or on 1st of January each year? Does the armed forces in general, like politicisation? How old are you? How did you get into it? How much are you paid and any perks you enjoy? What's your definition of patriotism and nationalism? With practical examples. [deleted] Aircraft Carrier or Submarine? how would you rate the prowress if the chinese naby Care to answer the questions, officer? I heard Indian Navy is as corrupt as Indian Army, Indian Air Force, and Indian government. How do you feel when your own soldiers are put at jeopardy with their lives with shoddy job done by mechanics and workers? All because some officer decides to pocket the repair money and write it off or buy mediocre equipment and parts just because they can get bribes from some manufacturer. 

Damn, someone forgot to close the hatch in a Submarine? Don't you guys have Checklist like in an airplane? Pilot and Copilot kind of deal? 

I seriously doubt you can win a war with this unprofessional behavior."
AMA,"[casual AMA] 37, M. kissless, handholdless, hugless virgin (khhv) here. AMA!",226,aws4pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aws4pb/casual_ama_37_m_kissless_handholdless_hugless/,282,"I am an unattractive and socially awkward person. Hardly had friends during college. Never had any GF. 

My parents started searching for a bride when was 25. When rejections started coming in, I gave up. It was again started when was 28-29. Same story. After 34, I and my parents, gave all hope. 

recently I read a comment here, even if you are single etc, your parents will get you married. Well, not all the time.

edit: comments are not appearing again. #RejectedByRedditToo",kaju_badam," What do you look for in a partner? 

What do you think is your best trait?

Any instances where you've felt lonely? How did you deal with it?  Hum kaale hain toh kya hua, apna time ayega Get an escort ? There shouldn’t be any taboo since we are all spending money for company, in one way or another  One of my earlier rejection stories:

After finishing engineering, I had to be at home for almost 2.5 years before I got the offer letter. Almost everyone who got hired with me, had their jobs delayed. (This was like 15 years back).

Anyways, I was really excited about the job and I was in training where I saw this beautiful lady in the same class. I had this instant crush, but no balls to walk up to her to talk. I did not really know it was called as 'dating', but you would just ask them for coffee at CCD and it meant that only. Or you would write a letter and give them. 

So, training was for 3 months and 2.5 months had already passed. Once training is done, you can be posted anywhere. Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. 

At that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said 'excuse me'. Which she didn't hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn't know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. 

That's it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.

can share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I'm just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What's the point of having an AMA if you don't answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It's ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There's two options you got:

1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. 
2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). 

The second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. 

Building great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. 

And learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I think your parent's social connection are weak, because there are many girls like you who desperately wants to marry someone and initiate normal family life, it's that you don't have reach to them (socially). The standard get rich/go to gym suggestions are silly. If that was the case more than half the men wouldn't get laid. I suggest the following:

1. This is also a failure of your social circle - your friends and family. Change who you hangout with. Make new friends. They have a responsibility to help you - remind them.

2. Most of my relationships started in *activites*. Badminton, board games, book clubs, cooking lessons etc. Find some activities and slowly improve your social skills. Even if there are only guys, they have friends and sisters they'll hook you up with.

3. Change your location. I don't know where you currently are but it's clearly not your destined place. Move to Goa or Himachal or a big city or even a different part of your current city.

 [deleted] You can go for hookers but the STDs are scary though. Not to offend you  but

What do you think is unattractive about you? Is it your physique, your expectations, or are you just ugly? (again, as a not so good looking guy I want to empathize your struggles and maybe share how you can improve)

What specific actions did you take to become desirable? Like did you start hitting the gym, wearing good clothes, being confident etc. ?

I'm 100% sure you can't be that repulsive ( Unless you have a physical disability..still its not 100% impossible). I would say maybe your standards are too high? 

Not to be condescending, because I'm going down this road and I think we should try to change our lives for the better :) Have u hit the gym to look fitter? Have you clothed smartly to show nice personality? Have you given helping hand to someone in need? Have you tried being part of office parties?

If answer to all these is yes - sanyaas le lo, kuch nahi honewala.

If answer is no - your parents should've belted your ass. *When rejections started coming in, I gave up*

Why so many rejections? Have you objectively analysed? 1. (Are you) / (Were you ever) interested in finding someone? 

2. Did you ever like somebody and actually approached them?  I am afraid I am seeing myself in you. 

But how do you hold up with your collegues? 

Do they also ignore/disrespect/avoid you?

Do you feel dumb sometimes because of not being able to hold conversations? I like how so many people are suggesting trips to Amsterdam or Bangkok or sex workers as if OP asked for advice on how to get sex  This is pretty interesting to me, both academically and personally. My questions:

What's your current occupation?

Did your parents look for a match ""below"" your status?

How is meeting all the relatives at weddings and parties like?

Have you come to terms with being a virgin loner for until some more time, or maybe even forever?

How is your mental health? Any signs of depression? Self harm? Addictions? Suicidal tendencies?

Do you smoke cigarettes? Drink regularly? Any hard drugs?

What are your religious views? Do you follow any particular philosophy of life?

I have a few more but would wait to see if you answer these. How are you now mentally? Did you have any kind of trauma growing up? Come friend, I will give you dosti wala lip kiss! How much porn do you watch? Never thought about hookers?  Are you happy? Have you found things in life that are fulfilling and meaningful? What are your hobbies? Remember you are a strong beautiful independent man that don't need no woman except Kali Maa. Your worth is not tied to how attractive women may or may not find you. I hope you're in a happy place emotionally speaking.  I mean unless you are physically deformed, I refuse to believe anyone is so ugly as to never get laid. A year of gymming, a decent haircut and some good clothes can go a long way [removed] In India, it is not at all a tough task to get married. All you need is money, are you well stuffed in that department ?  3 years till you become a Wizard. Me 10 years to go.

Ignore above congrats you are Wizard Harry. Apparently you become a Wizard at 30 for bring sexless  Why not lower your standards? Unattractive females with similar awkwardness? My two cents. If you are looking to get married search for girls of age just touching 35 because the social pressure would be enormous plus the age number will also add to it. Have you tried looking for a divorce or widowed girl as well ?? Just my opinion being a 28 yo woman and reading your statements -

• stop calling yourself unattractive. By saying this  have put yourself on a sort of lower scale & are probably treating others - especially people who YOU find good looking as better than you. 
Fact - they are not better

• socially awkward - have you ever analysed why you feel this way. Do you get anxiety when you enter a group of people, Or when you walk into a new place with unfamiliar faces?
Work on your confidence, watch some YouTube videos. Improve on your self worth & self esteem.
And stop caring what others think about you.
It doesn't matter, how you view yourself matters.

• coming back to your title -
So you haven't had a sexual experience. 
If you're constantly thinking about that, it'll make matters worse .
And if you really want some experience, go on tinder or start a friends with benefits with someone who is interested in you.
In the end even the experience won't help you get over the lonely feeling that one craves.

• people who are genuine & want real relationships can judge a person by their vibe.
If you're kind, genuine, helpful & a warm open person, you'll definately get really great women who would be interested in you.
But you have to build a personality for that, & not use excuses like I'm socially awkward, haven't had experience etc...
All that can be worked on. & I'm sure you have some role models or celebs. Watch how those people behave & carry themselves.
& Please stop going on your looks, or on anyone else's.


Hope this helps & sorry if I crossed any line Ye pubG wala hai kya? Lol I know I'll have the same faith. And guess what, I'll enjoy every moment of it. Marriage is overrated anyway. Amsterdam jao. somvar ke vart rakh bhai ladki jarur milegi pakka vada hai mera. Indian women are becoming independent as years go by and don't stay in marriages where the husband is an abuser or dowry problems, etc. So I think there are diorced women you can look out for or may be widows who lost their husband due to accident, etc.

Just go through matrimonial ads in news papers, you will surely find some one, don't give up, there is someone for you. Are you manglik? Women in India go for cash, not looks or personality.

But if you can't afford a new car, you can always go for second hand. Look in the ""caste no bar"" section of the matrimonials. They have all the divorcées and widows listed there. As a bonus, they'll be in your age range. And just to make you feel better, they usually have ""marriage not consummated"". Kind of like ""2 year old car, barely driven"". So even your parents won't mind. Bruv atleast you can bang a nice hooker just for the heck of it, nothing wrong if you keep the mortality aside. Posting on reddit or whatsapp wont solve the problem trust me. Just go and bang a bitch even if you have to pay, we will feel more relaxed and you wont be a Virgin after that I don't wish to karma-whore or hijack your Ama (though not really an ama if you do not reply, OP)

I'm in the same boat, kinda. I'm 21m, and haven't done those things either. My college is over, so I have no real way of meeting girls or anything now. Tinder really isn't my scene(not saying this to be one of those ""I don't think online dating is real"" people). Now I'm scared one day I'll be posting something like this too. It really is a hollow feeling man, I can almost physically feel the pain in my chest. Hope it gets better for you though, OP. 

Yes, I gym. No, I don't party coz most of my close friends are studying to be CAs, so I won't see them for the next 10 years. I work in my uncle's delivery firm, so no real work friends either. [deleted] [you should see this](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1101694386767912967) Have you visited /r/FA30plus or /r/ForeverAlone?
I'm Indian American and in your boat, except 31 years old. After how many rejections did you give up ? Just curios. Were you not comfortable comprising at all? I have seen street bums getting married.  What were the reasons for rejections?

 What line of work are you in? What kind of music do you like?  Why no hookers? Seriously. Has this affected your work life? Future me, how often and in what manner is this aspect of your life bright up by your friends and collegues?

An entirely new set of connections could alter the odds towards favourable. Have you considered marrying women from a poor background? What about someone is lower caste? If you are that desperate to marry, you should be okay with that. Most of them who are in the low economic class would be happy to marry someone who earns 1lpm. If feel if you don't don't have high expectations, it's not that hard to marry in India. Late here ... But I have a suggestion. If possible join a drama group or dance class even if you don't meet a girl there ... You may find the activity enjoyable. Were you at any point in your life not interested in marriages or relationships? I want to confirm, coz i am now at that point and not sure whether i regret about this in future. If you are not finding a partner, lower your standards.

Homeless, crippled, ugly as fuck  mofos find a wife. Why can't you?

 But are you willing to lower  your standards? Is it worth it? Now that, is another matter. Bro try some divorced women market. You will get easily one.no point in growing old alone  Sorry Late to the AMA...so here is my question...
You said you were tired of the rejection but how many eligible women did you reject?  You shouldn't feel bad. I seriously don't understand why marriages and relationships are hyped so much.. 

Please have intercourse to break the assumption.

Enjoy life to the fullest mate. Hey. Have you considered therapy and meditation? If you're not happy with yourself, you can't meet anyone. Confidence alone can get you places. 

How many of the rejections you have hat are because of your mind bringing up past rejections? It is your mind that is sabotaging a lot of the times, since you can't communicate with being frozen with fear and self conciousness. 

Find a good counsellor in your area (preferably Cognition Based Therapy). I know people whose lives have turned around because of that. Also, consider some form of meditation, or join Art of Living or some other meditation based support group.

Let me emphasize this. It is important to fix what you feel is wrong with yourself. You have to realise the value of this life and not give up on making it better. Pm if you wanna talk. 

Cheers :) ""I know how you feel"", because I'm just 4 years behind you. How does it feel to be not attractive? How does not being physically attractive affect the way you are treated in day to day life? What advice do you have for physically undesirable men? Dude there are many girls in there 30s who are also not getting married 

Apparently the corporates are giving holiday to go look for brides and grooms  hmm interesting.  almost mid 30's F here and single by choice. Unlike you I've had enough share of relationship and have ruthlessly dumbed quit a few for vivid reasons. One of them (as I go through your post) is self-pity. 
So my only one peace of advice would be to stop crying and self loathing, get your act together. 


I honestly have never come across any smiling face that's ugly. Rest sense of humor, confidence, positive aura, good physic  blah blah can always be worked upon only if you wish to put that extra effort on it. 


To end my point all I want to say is, no one likes to hear anyone's  *randi rona*. 

Good Luck. 


   What do you mean hug-less? Give yourself a hug ! Hug your parents :)  I would suggest you to get a hobby and a dog. Might help you to kill some time. 1) go to gym

2) Find way to get rich. *Scrolls down the entire thread*

... Please somebody tell this guy the meaning of AMA. Since you are a celibate anyway, you should spend some time at some ashram. That is the only good thing that can come out of this.  Are you using too much porn & musturbation from young age!!?  [deleted] Lol"

 Congratulations man!

Just curious, why did you get married so late (by Indian standards)? Were you apprehensive initially? If so, why? And how is your everyday life different now?

PS: I'm hitting 32 this year and I have very little interest in getting married.  When you were a kid, were you open to arranged marriages?

If no, when did your perspective change? If no, do you feel like you compromised your ideals in order to find someone?

If yes, were you scared about letting the other person down due to un-communicated expectations either of you might have from the other? If yes, are you scared of ever finding or running into someone now whom you might consider ""your perfect match"", but now ofcourse you cant do anything since you're in an arranged marriage Blink twice if you're being made to do this against your will  Malayali? chaliye naye couple ko vannakum.!

AMA,"Namaste, India! You might remember me from my ""I'm a Pakistani"" AMA here 7 months ago! Can we talk about war?",103,av9i7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/av9i7f/namaste_india_you_might_remember_me_from_my_im_a/,75,"Namastay, dosto!

I did an AMA here a while ago. You can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/)

It was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life. People started off slightly aggressive, with downvotes and sarcasm, but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas, ""Sharma jee ka beta"" mentality, newspaper liners in drawers, and swapping music and movies.

I'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.

Hamari zubaan ek hai, rang ek hai, libas ek hai, aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay. Just because you say dibba and I say dabba doesn't mean we can't get along.

I just wanted to ask my Indian dost how you guys feel about what's happening, and wondering if there's anything the people - you and I - can do to make things better?

**This is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance. Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.**

Please talk to me, and tell me your points of view.

Love you guys!

Dhanyawaad!",WhereIsLordBeric," It warms my heart to see your kind message.

People from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate. This doesn't mean that either side becomes a doormat. Definitely not. But I find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation. The loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for.

I think it is important for us Indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every Pakistani. That most of the people of Pakistan condemn the act. For this, it would help if Pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too. 

It will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities. A lot of the distrust is out of ignorance, out of just not knowing better. It is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasn't done genuine harm. People have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness, more truth can fix this. 

Most importantly, I would like to mention is that I'm Indian and we say dabba at home. I did not go through the previous AMA so if it was acknowledged that some Indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again. 

Edit: I realize I haven't asked a question here but I am looking to discuss ways to control the situation. Also I did want to ask about how it's portrayed by Pakistani news but someone already did.  Im scared. I have no clue how any of this is going to play out, I hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but I'm honestly worried I Might get drafted.maybe I'm paranoid, but we're talking about a possible nuclear war. What scares me most is how Indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes. I don't understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country. Yeah sure it was terror camps, but we shouldn't celebrate that. We should do it with reluctance. War is the last refuge of the incompetent. It shouldn't be worshipped. I was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said ""main sone chali neend mein thode Pakistani maarne hai"" 

I was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young ( I'm 19 she's 18 ) can have some much hatred. I get the anger that Pakistan **might** house terrorists and it's a matter of concern for both of the countries. Later on I ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picture.

But I see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hate.

I've seen enough documentaries and talked to enough American war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is. I'd never wish Something like this upon any of the countries.

I just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost. 

Thank you for your efforts. Peace.  Elections are coming, they will end and so will all the chaos. day by day I am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other. I am not in FB as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each other’s blood. war is a lose lose situation for both the countries, hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again. Whatever this is, this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on Indian soil through terror camps based out of Pakistan. It is a show of power, and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming. The only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country. Indian jets have crossed Pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only.  

This show of force isn't going to do anything because in the end the ISI/Military will be do what they have always done, send terrorists in with their blessings. Your governments have always been a puppet of the ISI. The utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten, nor will they ever forget. And Kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it. In the end, the citizens will suffer. Both sides of the border. And jingoism will continue. In the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best, and veg biriyani should be nuked.  [removed] Politics, attacks etc. may happen, but there is no need to hate a common Pakistani citizen staying in Lahore or Karachi who is busy minding his own job. I know we have these issues. They need to be solved mutually. Till then, you guys keep on producing music. We are producing our movies. Out of our hands really. Morons outnumber on both sides.  Welcome bhai.

Our leaders need sense.  There's absolutely no need for people to die.  Not Indian, not Pakistani.  At the end of the day we're all in this big messy world together.  This is so unnecessary.

Yes, love you guys too..
An Indian. Hi, can you help me understand why some Pakistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp. 

No civilian was harmed & no armyman was killed, so why the hate ?

and I have to say this, India & Pakistan is temporary, Chicken Biryani is forever. >Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.

It's because Elections are coming. This was the easiest and predicted way to cover up failure in governance. Hence this is the last refuge of any scoundrel who is in power. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, Gaddaffi and Saddam both did it to earn people's misguided belief. 

This can never happen in First world countries, knowing fully well people are smarter than a 5th grader which both our countries lack and the bullshit will be called off regarding what caused it. Both our governments are friends in the background and know each other's tastebuds, but like any actor's job they have to act like enemies for profit.

In the UN, both our countries ranks horribly in terms of basic human issues and aspects. That's why this is what the government has to offer to us. Sell Patriotism and to create that a bloody game of Hate and Carnage. 

The lucky ones are those from both our countries are those people who quit and settled down in first world countries for better lives and they get to fuel hatred by means of spending money and few comments. Meanwhile they share drinks and bang chicks and laugh in those first world countries tell both of us how stupid we are to fall for this.

Us Indians always puts a poor man down under the Sewage to clean and remove poop and toxics without protection. And we talk about injustice and revenge? Please. Why does your army have a chokehold over the civilian government? Since last time we met Gloria Jeans's outlet came up dude. Do you live in a major city? Have you tried imagining what a mushroom cloud will look like? I live in Karachi and was thinking of what it would look like and if I would see it in the distance before it hits me. I don't want war. I don't want people to die. But it seems inevitable now. The nut cases have taken over the government and they will take us to war for their greed and pride. Maybe increased  tourism can help bring down the ignorance. This next  one is never going to happen thanks to terrorism  but linent Visa and property , land owning laws between the countries . This will decrease the partition hate because both countries feel something was taken away from them forever .



My 2 chwanis on why we hate each other

Pakistan: Army controls everything even elected govt . To maintain / justify this control they need masses in fear of attack from a  strong and evil enemy. 

India : when ever we have a major festival or celebration or any happy time there's always an terrorist attack .sometimes it's busted sometimes they are successful ,they chant Allah hu akhbar while killing civilians and the organization which claims the attack is always based/operating from inside Pakistan . Point blank - can Pak, military establishment/ISI or govt, live without Kashmir? If not then there's nothing to discuss, Pak's one point agenda has always been ""the piece of land"" - if they weren't so dishonest about it the bloodshed of last 7 decades could've been avoided. India will not & cannot give up on Kashmir, so that's the bottom line.

Lastly good morning (evening?) to you, in whichever part of the world you are atm. I think you should educate all your fellow citizens to not support terrorism and vote for a government that  doesnt support terrorism.  

I know many of you all are peace loving people,  but you people should also take a stand against your government [removed]"

AMA,Some inside information about the 'support letter' situation in Maharashtra,0,e1btyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1btyt/some_inside_information_about_the_support_letter/,15,"I hope everyone is well aware about the political situation in Maharashtra right now. I will post TL;dr about the situation regardless.

\- No party has the majority

\- BJP fails to maintain the government

\- Shivsena isn't able to form a goverment

\- Presidents rule is applied

\- Shivsena + NCP + Congress prepares to form the government on Saturday afternoon

\- BJP + Ajit Pawar of NCP forms the government secretly at 5AM in the morning of the Saturday.

&#x200B;

The government is allowed to be formed by the Governor because Ajit Pawar produced a letter of support with signatures of all the MLA's of NCP. Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.

The reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.

Also, AMA I guess.",goldenGhostBanri," Is this pure speculation or these are facts., plus if Ajit was infact blackmailed, wouldn't it be easier for BJP to blackmail him to stage a NCP walk-out,during the floor test, thus reducing the halfway mark and giving BJP majority with the support of a few independents. Imo it seems Ajit pawar was tricked by dhananjay munde who was acting at behest of Sharad pawar.

Why sharad pawar is not removing him from party?? You could not be more wrong. The letter that Ajit Pawar submitted in the court today with the signature of 54 MLAs is the letter making him the Legislative Party Leader. That letter makes no mention of support to BJP. If such a letter endorsing BJP as you claim exists with BJP/Ajit Pawar then the case would be over by now.

> Also, AMA I guess.

No thanks."

I don't know how I can verify, but go ahead, Ask me Anything!

Edit 3:

#End of AMA!

You guys have been amazingly fun to converse with, and I thoroughly enjoyed this. I'll be an active participant in r/India and I hope to participate in the daily discussions too! Thank you, y'all!",IndianDaddy," How do u perform if u are not attracted to a particular client ?  Is it usually cover the face and fire the base ? How pp so big saar? Is it expected that a gigolo has model-like looks and sculpted physique? Are you getting business because of your looks/body? From which area most of your clients are? 

What exactly are these hen parties?

Do you pay taxes? 

What are the chances for not so good looking guy? 

I have heard gym trainers can get into this line easily. Is it true?

Do most people in Mumbai provide or take escort services?

Are you Indian?

Is this post part of your promotion strategy? Ye to asli Rocco hai.. wo eco grad tha from lse, iirc Hi. I have few questions. Few may arise later too. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Have you ever considered going for gay parties? Even if the pay was high.

2. What are government rules that one gigolo should be aware of one's safety if any situation arises with the police? And any personal rules too would work.

3. Any experience of Orgies?

4. You said that ""...nobody lies as much as porn"". What do you think can the porn do to better the viewer experience more realistic?

5. Do you get worried about STD's? Also, how many times 
a month do you go to Doctor?  I wasn't even aware this was a scene in India.

1. How did you become a professional gigolo? 
2. How do women hire you?
3. Is it fun at the parties as they show in porn? Or is there too much pressure? u/wannabeGigolo *Humko kehte Superman.... On Kar lo handycam...* Did you ever get caught? Does this effect your relationship? Do you mark out quick exit points, in case the husband/boyfriend arrives?  All i want to say is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) *Nice* How much do you charge for 1 bob? 1. What exactly do you mean *boytoy*? What are those stripper parties like?

2. Have you even been physically / mentally abused? Do you any form of protection from the same? (Like being part of some group or something) How often do you suggest ideas/improvise etc about a session and how often do you partake in predefined activities only as suggested by clients?

Any role playing idea you’d love to pitch in a clients head that you’re excited about? 

Do all your clients establish consent before they randomly try something new with you or do you have some set boundaries or are you mostly flexible in your realm? What are some of the prejudices you encounter ? And how could I evade such prejudices, when talking to a friend who's in a similar line of work? How's your mental health?

Has your perception of women changed since you heh, entered the field?

If you were to give a few pointers towards sex-ed for the younger folks (not explicit stuff rather as in consent and boundaries etc) what would you have to say? 
1. Is it circumcised? What do women prefer?
2. Is it naturally 8.5 are did you use anything to increase the length?
3. What things in diet should one avoid to have a great stamina during sex? Have you been emotionally involved with them? 
Have you ever been blackmailed by them ?
 1. Do you have a girlfriend? If you do, does she know about your this line of work?

2. Do you intend to stop after some time? Let's say, like a financial goal or a relationship goal?

3. How did you meet the first lady who helped you out with the rest of the clients?

4. Have you met any of them outside of the sex in public? What was it like? Have any clients ever made non-sexual demands? Like cuddling, talking, friendship etc? How have you dealt with it? Noice. 

Reference milega kya bro? How can I pass my engineering exams ? Have you denied clients? Why? 

Do you own costumes / any special items? Jesus dude. Econ grad who does work for think tanks doing this on the side? 

Have you considered applying for scholarships/PhD overseas? That might actually help you get out of here and do something more meaningful. You seem like a bright chap and if you found yourself doing this, you sure are helluva creative problem-solver. I'm sure you can figure something out instead of doing this, as much fun as it might be, isn’t the best use of your education/potential. 

PS - Not judging/hating. If you enjoy it and that's what you want to do, for sure keep doing it. All your answers seem too generic to be believable unless you can verify. Don't have a question, just want to to tell you to stay safe. How do u keep a room full of strangers engaged? Do u get to the act straight away or?  What all activities do you involve in? Can you elaborate on that? According to you what causes immense pleasure for a woman? Is it penetrative sex? Favourite experience?

How much anal?

 [deleted] You say you charge 4k to 7k. Why haven't you charged more? I'm amused cos upper middle classish people spend more that on a night out drinking and you're offering them an experience. If you're gonna go out and do something risky why not up the charge? Say 15k? Have you given this a thought? What am I missing here? 5 to 7k seems low AF. Mind you, I'm completely unaware of the money dynamic in this scenario. Also do you optimise clients/sessions for money per hour made or fun per hour had? 

Thanks and Good luck. * You sound really smart and eloquent. If you don't mind me asking, how was your life so far in socioeconomic terms? You've mentioned that you work hard on your physical appeal, but how much of your attractiveness do you think comes from your mind? 

* Would someone who is maybe as attractive physically but not so impressive mentally still be as popular? how much infedility you noticed in this line of work? i mean does every other rich women/girls use sevices like this? You’re pretty fair skinned right ? I have been quite curious and obsessed with this stock Nasdaq:ROKU . Even after great quarterly numbers and higher expectations next quarter, the stock took a nosedive and plunged by 25%.

My gut says it's just a Wall Street shake off by institutions trying to shake off all the dumb money before going long on this. But I'm also terrified because the next support could be  well below $35 and I may lose 33% of my investing capital.

Do you think it would be a good buy? I'm planning to get in at $43 and exit at $50 in 3-6 weeks. The 52 week high was at $70. Are any pimps involved? Usually a trade of this nature invariably has some element of organized crime involvement where they traffic people never let them leave the business. So is there something of this sort involved?  Ever had a threesome? 1. What's your workout routine like?

2. Is there a need to be fashion conscious or just suit and shoes work?

3. Any preference by clients on body hair? How does it feel to be a gigolo?  How long is your dick?. Do you do anal to or vice versa [deleted] The last sentence in edit 2 though 😂 Econ Grad huh.. 
TN Srinivasan must be so proud from his grave. 1 .Worst experience ?
2.what are some wierd fetish requests you have received from women ?
 Tis a strage thread with a justified poster Guide me sir  Like someone asked what are the exit points u have planned incase of being caught by husband/boyfriend/police ?

Incase of sexual harrassment complaints against you, how are you going to defend yourself ?
 [deleted] What is the average age of your clients? Also what was the age of your youngest & oldest customer Tips for better dick health. What’s the yearly earning potential?

What’s the monthly expense? Include grooming, clothing, food, toys.

What’s the upper weight limit for this job?

Any grooming tips you’d like to share for ordinary guys who just want to go to work in an office and come back home. What app do you use to text your clients. WhatsApp or Telegram?

By having your number (assuming you use WhatsApp) aren't you primed for having your cover blown by a disgruntled client? What's your fitness routine? Height, weight, bicep size and do u even lift bro? What's the age of the oldest woman you have fucked ? A friend of mine told me about these hen parties she when too. But there were 3-4 guys. Are these parties anything like Dancing Bear, lol? I mean I know how wild they are in the west, but how wild are they in India? any famous or celebrity client? Best of luck for graduation. you doing great mate :) What is the age group of men that your clients generally seek? What does your diet look like? Do women especially the Bridge have sex with you at bachelorette parties?  Do you write @ ISS(Indian Sex Stories) ?
If not, start doing so.
 What were the kinkiest demands of your clients?  1. Have you been in any situation where they physically hurt you? 
If no, what would you do if you encounter such situation? 

2. What are the scene of cuckold in India? I have seen a huge number of cuck accounts in Tumblr. Most of them are paid couples. 

3. Would you recommend anyone else for this thing? Why? 

4. Do you think someone should get into this just to fulfill their fantasies/kinks?

5. Are most of your clients rich?

 I'm assuming your clients are mostly rich women. What is the age range, relationship status that your clients come from? Are they mostly married, unsatisfied women, as pop culture would have us believe? Or are there young women too?

What kind of demands do they place on you? Just sex? Or is emotional intimacy, companionship a part of the deal too? Hey good to here that you are doing great in the industry. I have tried to become one of you but the agents online are the scammers and i have been looted . They ask for pre meet money or membership fees.

I thought you may help me out by sharing something so i could aslo be like you .... Plz do reply!! Fake Title should be 'me trying to earn internet stranger's trust to get some desperate aunty pussy' posing as a 'professional gigolo' Tell us about the clients, are they physically gross. How often do you turn them down? Ever felt guilty or ashamed of yourself ? Do you feel uncomfortable facing mirrors sometimes ? 

No, I don't mean to humiliate you . Just asking about the guilt psychology. Do you think you would not need such meaningless extra jobs and would earn a decent living with NGO and think tank work if you were living in a Marxist Utopia? Why though? Can you show a full body pic of yous minus the face? I'm honestly curious to see how you look since this just seems a little too out of my imagination (I'm from a very sanskari family and an ugly women repellant so u r basically my opposite) PM me if you don't wanna post here How exactly did you end up in this situation? Why not take a regular job like BPO/KPO/ bank sales instead? I have links to real life Indian gigolo videos. I cannot post them since I am in office right now. Please remind me to post them in a few hours. How far people go to get attention from internet strangers. First of all what do you think of our country current economy like will it improve or will the currency still fall. Also another question I have might seem a bit desperate but I still got to ask. You see I am a guy with avg looks and same down there(5inches). You see being on the internet and talking to others has placed a lot of insecurities for me. But I still wanna know the truth. What are the chances if I get married that the would be wife will cheat on me due to lack of sexual satisfaction and can I do anything to change it. Or should I just see marriage as merely a contract and not be too much attached to her and keep an eye on the side for fun myself(not my favourite path since part of me still has this romantic idea of love and marriage,dumb I know but its who I am). Or is it better I remain single? Sorry to ask such a question man but if possible give me a truthful answer. I dont mind even if it is a painful one as a painful truth is better than any sweet lie."

Only a civil services aspirant knows the struggle.

I too shunned every social networks and am on reddit. Hey, congratulations.

I want to start preparing right after my BSc in Physics.

When I clear Mains and get called for interview, will the panel mind that I am very young and don't have any job experience?
Can you please give me any input on that?

Edit: I have already began my preparation, in a manner. I am reading Indian Express everyday, started reading Indian history and economics (finished 9th standard). Do you think hard work + smart work is enough to crack UPSC? Isn't there a lot of luck involved considering only around 300 general students get selected out of around 10k+ seriously studying for it. Do you feel you got lucky in the first attempt? Wow. Happy for you. Congratulations!  Do an AMA if possible. Please marry me? Also, congratulations. Waiting for your AMA. r/Indian_Academia Ama please Congratulations op.

How your life have changed before starting the preparation and after finishing the prep? i mean, what is the effect of this exam on ones personality? Our civil administration does need some psedo liberals.
 Bahut Badhaiyan!
Will be waiting for AMA. *Matrimonial sites want to know your location* Congrats, OP. Hope you will serve the nation to the best of your ability. Congrats liberandu 🏆 People asking about how to clear upsc, use Quora, har jagah shuru hojate ho Congratulations! Please add basic info like optional subject, coaching centre etc. in the original post.  Hey so can u tell me if is it possible to compete UPSC through arts stream or do I have to take science? My parents say science makes it much easier. I don't know how but I guess u can shower some knowledge on it. DO REPLY PLEASE!!!!! Congrats bro, hope you will not convert into some  grumpy ""sir"" very soon. chalo, let's get married. I'm doing MBBS, so we can be the couple of every indian middle class household's dreams Congratulations and welcome to ‘the fellowship’ 😄 I just hope op remembers us when time cometh. congrats bro , hope to see your blog up at insights/forumias soon , all the best  Thanks I hate it. My parents have been telling me stories of kids who cleared UPSC all day.

Seriously though, congratulations brother. Hey... Remember this day whenever you feel depressed or demotivated somewhere along your work. Remember that you have the power to help the needy, do the right thing and stand up against people who do our society bad.

Congratulations. Congrats and most important question.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Congrats Buddy! Dont become one of those 'file sign' sahib. Try to take initiatives and most importantly lower rank officers are one who are corrupted state civil officers/tehsildar etc...so maybe try to bring honesty in department. All the best we need more young officers like you. Proud OP, the score in written part is in my control, I get based on how well I write. Now coming to the interview, how does the panel look at candidates who didn't give up, like let's say I have been at civils for 4 years after my graduation, doesn't that create a bad impression as in the candidate should have done something else rather than putting eggs in one basket?  Ay my man Mark Antony Congratulations  Congratulations! I never thought the day will ever come when an Indian redditor gets to go inside the heart of the national 'system'. Kudos to you.

On a different note (Not trying to be a party pooper or anything),  I feel it's my duty to bring the following up. 

Now the reality of the country's governance, working for the smug senior bureaucrats, swallowing one's pride and principles at the orders of our unethical, poorly literate and absolutely ruthless political masters should hit you after your training.

Don't let these things get you down. Stick to your principles. You will learn to 'adapt' to the system ( but don't do it too much!). At all times, please remember Gandhiji's Talisman. That should make your dilemma easier.

Much respect and well wishes from a concerned citizen. Legalize marijuana when you get there [deleted] Well apparently not all of us randians are useless it seems lol...Btw congratulations on your success, I too aspire to join the services someday Congratulations! You're now in a position to make a difference. Don't shun your values and don't become corrupted. Congratulations to you!! 

Overwhelmed to see a fellow redditor get into the Services, so freaking happy and inspired!! 

56 more days to 2019 Prelims and I really hope I get to post here the good news next year!  Another corrupt Government Employee.  Congratulations!!! Congratulations.

Have a great time, ahead :) Congratulations, please do an AMA. Congrats Mate.  Congratulations!!  Congratulations! Hope you will do great to this country. Congrats brother! Treat? Congratulations, how old are you?  Congratulations! Congratulations on your achievement. I hope you serve the country well.  Yes Congratulations OP Congratulations, dude. Good to know that you cleared one of the most difficult exams in the indian context.

Now get ready for the real battle. Congrats man! This is so wholesome.  Congrats man!  all the best!  Cngrats. Happy for you. 👍 By any chance are you sharma? General category? Congratulations!! Please do an AMA!  Toh kya kren bc Congratulations! Try to be not corrupt!  Dude other services means?? I thought UPSC was for IAS only. Congrats on the exam clearance. But what really makes you exited to be a bureaucrat? You will literally be a cog in the wheel your whole life now. Are you that Kataria guy? Congrats buddy. I wish you the best of luck. Let's clean up and better our country together. 👊 Congratulations!! Congratulation man!! Go and do good.... Acha bath hai Hey that's some positive news to hear today. Good luck with your tenure and be true to yourself and the country. God Bless your journey and your intentions... Congratulations.  You are the unrequited fulfilment of many of the India's citizens. Congrats stranger ! I will also write a post like this someday :) My cousin cleared the same and now my life will becomes hell, a whole lifetime of “why you couldn’t be more like him” non sense its good for you though sure congratulations but it sucks for the rest of your cousins and siblings unless they’re all ias too Congratulations! Hope you have a successful career and you make a big impact wherever you go. There is lots to be done in the country and it is time for our generation to be the change was have always wanted. 

 Super Congratulations to you!

I want to prepare as well, but can't leave the current job for financial responsibilities. Will jot down a plan for doing so over a two year period, let's see how it turns out. Congrats mate! ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" You beauty! Congrats, my brother! I don't know why but I feel very happy and proud! :) Do an AMA please! Congratulations dude!! Now do the good work!  You cleared i  first attempt. That's great. Can you shed some light how to clear this exam. How to prepare ? How much hours you studied ?   Congrats. UPSC isn't my cup of tea. I'll be trying for ESE soon. Let's hope I am able to cope up with entirely different stream :V My dear brother, as much as I want to clear UPSE, I am afraid I am a bit weak in history and geography. I have a decent public sector job and I am trying to clear one of the major exams of 2019. Wish me luck as well. I will hit you up this time around next year with my results. Saving your post for future communication ease. You give me inspiration. 

Also, congratulations are well in order! Please do not get corrupted and do not waste your time like Dipak Rawat raiding small businessmen. I honestly think doing service to the poor should be the top priority. Hope you do us some justice and I hope you do not get pressured politically much. My best wishes are with you.  Congrats, but this isn't facebook. Indian parents want to know your location!! So you browsed reddit and cleared UPSC? KAISE?  Congratulations. Thank you for striving to make India a better place Wish you all the very best in your career.  ""Forever in your service, starting this August"" are seriously going to work for the people or for the ministers or just for the sake of perks you will enjoy rest of your life.

Source: Wikipedia
""In India's parliamentary democracy, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the people's elected representatives—cabinet ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants, who serve at the pleasure of the President of India, to carry it out.""

I never understood the concept of working for minister who don't have a degree but want a professional who had cracked objective questions in seconds, penned downed his thoughts flawlessly on holycow and ofcourse his interview rounds.

Would love hear the real reason behind to go for civil services of India.

I am sure the one who has so much knowledge with degree can lay polices also. Clear this dilemma please. Noice Congratulations man

I hope this one feat. Makes you leave a mark of honesty and integrity in india
I love my country but at the same time the petty politics and sheer corruption at every end makes me feel like an alien 
.i wish you propel to change whatever you can under your limits

All the best for your future

 Bhaiyaa strategy bataa do! Congratulations OP, here's to serving this beautiful country. Good Luck OP !!  Congratulations brother, not cse but i cleared upsc ese this year! Man just don't fuck up the area wherever you get posted you know what I mean Congratulations !!! Now go partyyy ! Congratulations friend. Take this country in a good direction as best as you can. Jai Hind! What do you plan to join? Congratulations OP!  Now you have a chance to make a difference. Keep it up my boy..u can do it. Humor me , why clearing the IAS is such a big deal when getting MD in dermatology in AIIMS ,New Delhi is far more difficult . Of all the students in India who will complete MBBS only 4 will get it .  Congrats buddy! All the very best :) Hearty congratulations buddy :) All the very best :) Happy for you dost,
Best of luck. I have 2 years at my disposal, how should I approach this examination? Congrats dude! 
One of my seniors got 210th rank too
 Best wishes and congratulations.. Please make this country a better place.  Congrats dude!  What is this exam and what type of job do you get? Congratulations Congratulations. How old are you? I'm 23 and I'm preparing for nimhans entrance this year and next year I'll start preparing for upsc. Please guide me. What was your schedule like, books and websites that you referred, self study or class?  Congratulations OP. One of my nephew's friends was also preparing for the exam. Your description kind of matches him so I wonder if you are in fact him.  Keep us updated mate. Congratulations on your achievement. Well you can use code words to tell us what did you end up choosing. Congrats OP. Be an honest officer and you can help men and women of the country way more than rest of us can.

  
All the best!  
 Congratulations! Make the Constitution proud! Live long and prosper 🖖 Can you share your daily schedule if possible? Very congratulations to you! Thank you for sharing your happiness with us.

If you don't mind me asking, exactly how many months/years of study you put into preparation?

Also, do you have any bad habits, like smoking, drinking, girls, etc? Congrats, welcome to the services. Look me up if u r allotted maharashtra cadre. Congrats Man.  Happy Future of oppressing the poor and getting corrupted.  Congratulations 🎊  Congrats bro!!! Good to know that u are from general category 👍👍 (read a comment below) Many many congratulations mate! Just 2 Questions -

* At what age did you start preparation for UPSC?

* Did you take *any* coaching?

I'm an aspirant myself. Congratulations! No offence , but are you sc/st or OBC ? As they have quotas , it's easy for them. it is extremely sad to see that indians in 2019 have dreams of working for the indian government and see it as the pinnacle of achievement.

It is very, very sad to see that the oppressive Raj has been replaced with indian rulers. That the population is blind to this is even more discouraging. The incentives of the Raj are almost exactly the same as that of the indian bureaucrat: exploitation and self-enrichment. They have not changed one bit. There are honest people in the bureaucracy but they are few and far between.

It should give us pause that we are celebrating someone joining the single largest organisation responsible for the loot of the nation on a daily basis: the government and bureaucracy. So, what is so appealing in civil services? I am sorry guys, if this sounds offensive to the post. But, I have not been in my country for about 9 years now. And had I known that I can also give civil services and end up in a good position in India, I would have definitely tried. Again, please don’t think I am undermining anything that the OP has done. And, another question is, can this exam be given by a person of any age? Like me, I am 31. Can I also give this exam and get into a good position in India? Thanks for listening patiently guys. Again, I repeat, no offense to the original poster. Peace! 

Comgrats to OP!!!! Sorry, my bad... Good, now lick Mudi kaka's arse 😂"
AMA,'Sacred Games' AMA with Vikramditya Motwane and Varun Grover,295,92lsbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/92lsbe/sacred_games_ama_with_vikramditya_motwane_and/,530,"We are:

Sacred Games show-runner + director Vikramaditya Motwane (Earlier, Director of Udaan, Lootera, Trapped, and Bhavesh Joshi)

and Sacred Games writer Varun Grover (earlier writer of 'Masaan' and lyricist of 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Ankhon Dekhi', Dum Laga Ke Haisha' etc)

We are here to answer questions about our recent Netflix series 'Sacred Games' - the first Netflix original from India.

Note: No questions regarding speculations about future seasons will be entertained.

UPDATE: Hi this is Varun Grover. Am stepping away for now. Will come back to answer some more later tomorrow. It was great fun. Thanks for your enthusiasm and love.

UPDATE 2: Vikram Motwane has also logged out. ""THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit."" ",vidushak," Thank you Varun and Vikramaditya for taking out the time to do this. It was a lot of fun interacting with you guys.

The AMA is over for now, Varun might drop in and reply to a few more questions later. Could there be a separate Netflix special of Katekar * No questions.
* Just came here to read and say thank you to both of you for such an amazing show. What happened to the guys who were locked by Anjali Mathur? XD Kukoo being discovered in the men's washroom. why would she not go the female washroom (and successfully hide her secret)? 
was it just for the audience (exposition)? What was so special about Sacred Games that you decided, yes, this is the one on which we'll make a TV series?  Sartaj is so morally upright - In the book he does take the occasional bribe / Hafta & the series doesn't  show that, Some petty corruption by policewalas is generally accepted without any judgement even in real life too, So why paint him so White?  THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit.  Hey u/vmotwane , a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? When and will the OST of the show be out on music platforms?  hello all. great to be here!!! Max Mueller said that **""Mythology is a disease of language.""** That human beings have a habit of creating ideas/things and worshiping them as real things (reification).

Is there no way to counter the power of these tribal tendencies? Are we stuck between religious symbols  on one hand and patriotic/nationalistic symbols on the other?

What do you think about Yuval Noah Harari's hypothesis in Sapiens that myths are necessary for large number of humans to co-operate? Sartaj = Sacred, Gaitonde = Games? To Vikram, thank you for udaan. it's beautiful. I have seen it many times and actually showed it to my parents. they have now become your fans as well. :) The actor who was most likely to burst out laughing during a take? in first episode gaitonde's eyes are closed when he shots himself and they are open when sartaj looks at him again.....just tell me is this thing intentionally done for the story or is it just a creative touch to depict his background voice...2 din se sapne me bhi yehi doubt aa raha hai...just clear kardo The scene where Isa's men hit Gaitonde's home and he has to defend had a similar vibe to the scene in Gangs of Wasseypur. Was that intentional? Can you tell us the story of how Jitendra Joshi got casted as Katekar. Hello!

1. Why Zoya's characters look much younger than she actually should be acc. to the timeline of this series? Even Gaitonde, that marathi lady and also Sartaj's mother should've looked a decade older than they did in the 2018 storyline.

2. Why the present arc was set in 2018 instead of last decade?

3. What's next? Can we expect any announcement regarding any upcoming webseries soon? Have you ever seen pirated version of Netflix shows? Varun, the show had some extremely creative cuss words. Who comes up with them? How much of those are improvised? Bunty as a character hardly had any redeeming quality to him unlike Gaitonde and yet he managed to be quite charismatic and a treat to watch. How did you guys pull that off?  Varun what went into changing the timeline of the book to present day? Mumbai has changed so much since the book was written and so has technology what kind of impact did it have to the story in your opinion? Is Gaitonde Arun Gawli? * Why did you guys decide on historic episode names rather than going for standard ones ?

* Also, bit unrelated, but when can we expect Bhavesh Joshi sequel ?

* If not Nawazuddin, who do you think would've done the same amount of justice to Gaitonde's role as him ? What benchmark did you set to evaluate Sacred Games post season 1? Since it is a completely different medium for the both of you how do you judge how successful season 1 was? Any other book that you've read/know of that you would want to see adapted into an Indian web series, regardless of whether you're a part of it.  What's the most legitimate criticism are you working towards improving in future seasons? I love the portrayal of women in the series. There are hardly any movies or TV series which show such wide roles of women in a story. We have a mother, a whore, a girlfriend, a god mother, a lover, a goddess, a RAW officer, a divorcee, an actress, a wife, a sister. Each playing an important role in their life or of the men attached to them. I believe the book has to be credited for it. Why do you think we don't see this more often in Bollywood or even Hollywood Cinema ?  [deleted] Hi Sirs !
Congratulations on your success! God speed!

Q. Since both of you have worked in making of a movie, how was it different from making a Netflix series ?

Q.How much did the fact, that there is no CBFC to crap over your work, help you in expressing your artistic ideas ? Varun: Are you a full time writer now ? Given the success of SG. Or when is your next stand up tour planned for ?  Who came up with the idea of casting saif ali khan Did you give the actors any tips about their characters before the shoot? Did you advise them to read the book or put their own spin on the origin material? Please tell us a bit about the global response/feedback that Netflix would have received and may have given you specifically about the language. Because I have a feeling that the English audio and subtitles were not upto the mark. Even the folks in North India seems to have had issues understanding the Mumbaiya Hindi used. Could we get both of your views on that please. This is something I was thinking of when I watched the show. How did you expect the general public to react to the various sex scenes and nudity ghat show contained? Did you think you might have to answer to some random FIRS which are filed in the different parts of the country. Also - did you not consider the censor board threat?  Varun bhai, woh sab chhodo, ye batao ki Lucknow kab aa rahe ho? Hey Varun, which particular actor surprised you the most with their performance in terms of taking your writing to the next level just with their performance? A character that either of you wish didn't have to die so soon purely because their future arc could have been really interesting to explore? Hi, when Zoya reads the news of Gaitonde's death on Twitter, the tweet below the news tweet is a real tweet from November 2013 but story's timeline is June, 2018. So is that a random minor error or a reference to something? (Link to the tweet - https://twitter.com/naveen/status/403280901498368001?s=19) Malcolm is one of the most intriguing characters in the show, What made you cast Luke Kenny as Malcolm? (He was awesome)  
 Hi Varun/Vikram,

I liked Sacred Games a lot and cannot wait for the next season. My questions are:

* What were a few things in your vision that you could not pull off in Season 1? 
* What were some of the the constraints you faced while making SG S1?
* Are you working on any other projects with Netflix? (would love to see this partnership continue)

Regards

FAN  Hey! Hey!

First things first, kudos for the excellent work! Loved it!

Question: Radhika Apte says: get the IFS list. Gets someone named Sharma. Then says on the phone **""Sharma matlab Trivedi"" How?!**

Nameplate outside Trivedi's residence and everywhere else says Trivedi. Then why and how is Sharma is on the list. Why Sharma == Trivedi? The AMA is verified How is working with Netflix? What was the conversation in Writer's Room about Katekar's Death? Did you ever consider not killing him? How Killing him helps the Story? Couldn't you have used a lot more of him in future episodes? When will the music from Scared Games going to get released?(especially the intro music)

Do you think the story has enough fuel to make it through 4 seasons?

BTW I loved Trapped and thought it was more haunting then most of the horror movies in Bollywood. Also can you ask Anurag to release the remixed song ""Mere pairon main"" used in Mukkabaaz since it was pretty  dope. Hello Vikram and Varun,
I loved the show. Was your creative process for the show different from directing/writing a feature film? Which one do you prefer?  Hey Varun & Vikram, Hope you had lot of fun making Sacred Games. The background music was amazing & I have some doubts, problems with show but one basic question I have is this : Can you please tell me the reason why Sartaj was not killed immediately after he was caught by Mourad's men. What's the logic behind keeping Sartaj alive and Mourad torturing him? 

 Why is trivedi referred as sharma If babaji's bodyguards only rescues gaitonde how does matthu survive those men? (As he is in the opening scene) Hi! I liked Sacred Games, especially how every element had a lot of thought behind it. 
the 

There is this one thing which was baffling: how realistic was the portrayal that Gaitonde didn't know Kukkoo was a transgender, even after having sex for months? Did you expect the whole ""Rajiv Gandhi"" backlash? How come Trivedi and gaitonde were wearing the same kurta I still got goosebumps while watching chasing scene of Udaan, Thanks for that movie. Saif in his recent interview with Rajeev told that you MIGHT not direct the season 2 ? Why the fuck ? 

If Netflix brings in David Fincher/James Watkins and asks you to step down from director of SG season 2  ? Would you do it ?

Wouls you trade it for one episode of Black Mirror ?

P.S please don't do it for the world. We love you. Any recent Hollywood film you loved? As I have not read the book, is the story long enough to cover the four seasons planned?

For me this series was right up to the level of Breaking Bad and am really excited for season 2. Hey varun ,which genre you feel you have not explored and would like to do it the future? How can one pitch a show to Netflix? Kudos on the awesome series guys. Here r my questions ;

Did u expect this level of positive reception?

What's the timeframe you're targeting for the release of second season?  Hey, so when can we expect the ""Desh Sankat Me Hai"" promos for S2? 
 Vikram: I've been watching your movies for quite some time, from Udaan, to Lootera to Sacred Games. But frankly I had no picture to the name. Have you started coming out more and giving interviews a lot more than earlier ? Or is it just the success of the show that has pulled you out of your closet ?  Who exactly was Subhadra?
Kantabai's daughter? Hey guys, it's great to see so many characters and actors getting their due appreciation. Although I think Kanta Bai is an interesting character who deserves a better arc. Wish to see more of her in the upcoming seasons. 
 I really loved the design and references to mythology that you guys have on the show and the title/titlecards, Whose idea was to incorporate these elements in the show? They added a great new dimension which we rarely see in Indian shows. Did you think of casting Nana Patekar in the role of Gaitonde? Personally I felt Nawazuddin's 'physique' didn't match his 'stature'. IMHO. The character of Anjali Mathur is said to have been quite different from the book. Why was the decision to make it a ""feminist"" kinda character made? Amidst characters with very region-specific characterisations, Radhika Apte's character had no notion of religion or upbringing in a specific geography, etc. (e.g. Sartaj being a Sardar, Gaitonde being a Hindu from Maharashtra) Was that an intentional characterisation of her, given that she was a RAW agent? Her role somehow seemed unchanged from Lust Stories to Sacred Games. For Varun \[@vidushak\] - Who do you rely on to proofread your writings, to find gaps if any, to suggest improvements? Hi, could you please tell us about the casting, how were the actors decided and were there any compromised done? Saif Ali Khan did a great job imo. What made Phantom venture into the horror genre and produce Ghoul on Netflix? Vikram, as a creator, how much of an impact did you think the background score have on the final product? Top 5 foreign movies(non-English) you've watched? To VG: did you write any sequence that had to be altered on screen because of volume/intensity of cuss words?  What's with the colour palate/tone of the film? Was it your choice or its dictated by Netflix?  Hi Vikram and Varun Grover, I haven't read the book but I think the character arc of Sartaj Singh is very similar to a real life filmmaker. Sartaj witnesses that Parulkar killed Junaid even though he wasn't armed etc. Sartaj gets angry and walks out of the hearing, since can't see injustice happening etc. But much later we see Sartaj becomes part of the system and gives the statement in favour of Parulkar. Thus he empowers Parulkar. Probably Parulkar was aware that nothing will happen to him and everyone will favour him and hence committed the crime (no matter how honest any of his colleagues are). This is very similar to filmmaker who came to know that his partner(a filmmaker) was involved in sexual harrasment, got angry, wanted to set things right but eventually favored his colleague and let him continue work, thus becoming part of the patriarchy system and ended up empowering his colleague. Curious to know if the arc was inspired by this real story?  Will we get OSTs on digital platforms for the series? Smart thinking on having Divine for Kaam 25, he is fire. Hi Vikram,
I want to know if that glass wall in Gaitonde's hiding place was inspired from the glass wall of Jimmy's office in Better Call Saul? (link- https://imgur.com/96ii4pj)  Hey Vikram, any of your favourite scenes that didn't make the final cut? Can you share anything about them? I love Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad and Better call Saul (I heard Mr. Motwane does too). Specially love how these two use some simple, recurring personal conflicts as the core without needing to add new conflicts every episode or season.

With the nuclear coming in I’m afraid season 2 might get even more over plotted. I hope Im wrong (I should read the book for the answer?) Any adjustments you guys plan to bring to the writing? I’d be super curious to know. When do we expect the Second Season ? 
Any tip from Netfilx side ? 
 1. How exactly are we hearing Gaitonde’s narrator voice after he has killed himself? Is all this exposition happening in Sartaj’s imagination? Or did Gaitonde have so much time on that phone call to tell him about all of this?
2. Really appreciated the fact that everybody spoke in their native languages. But I felt that principle was broken by having Gaitonde speak so little Marathi. Was this deliberate? If so, why? Hey. Who was the most fun person on the set?

Sacred Games is a masterpiece. I loved the show and would like to see more of Sartaj soon. Hello Varun, Vikram! 
Here are my questions for the both of you

1. I admire your writing for its consistency and nuanced attention to detail, but I connect the most with the emotional depth and honesty.
My question is how do you choose where to draw the line in terms of emotional honesty, or at what point do you find it to be counterproductive, as far as character growth is concerned? 

2. Has there been anything that you've pitched and Netflix has protested? Or do you have full creative control over the show? Greetings! Thanks for doing this!   


For Vikram - Favourite memory working with Anurag Kashyap?  


For Varun - Which movie has inspired you?   


Again,thanks for doing this and absolutely loved Sacred Games! Cheers!  Some dialogues seemed directly derived from the stories behind the episode titles - was that a consciously done or is it just coincidence?Example: [np.reddit.com/r/sacred\_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation\_correlating\_episode\_titles\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sacred_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation_correlating_episode_titles_to/) What did inspire the fake encounter sub-plot? On one hand we see you guys launching so many talented actors (especially women) here with such a strong cinema and brilliant story, and on the other hand Bollywood couldn't even manage or better spoiled a good story (sairat) just to launch some dumb ass star kids. Your take on this. Of course I am talking about your opinion on Nepotism in Bollywood.  Hello to both the lovers of the art. My question is for both of you -

Do you had many of the parallels/references, that are coming out now about particular scenes, in your mind right from the beginning? The best one I saw was Gaitonde the young kid saying - ""Apun ko naya dharam mangta tha"" to Buddha going out in search of truth, and *founding* buddhism.

 Hey guys, loved the series.

Mainstream Bollywood still seems to live in a dream world of rich kids facing limp conflicts. Rural India is shown as clean, colorful with its own set of 'cliche' issues. Any body who has traveled into even urban rural areas knows how dirty and grimy it is.The romanticization of shitty things in India ('The Spirit of Mumbai!!!') has gone too far. Our people always attend movies where everything is rosy and the fucked up things in our country are shown as memes unto themselves. Movies in a lot of ways define culture and mainstream Bollywood seems to not understand this. They think entertainment is innocent. Any thoughts regarding this?

In the endeavor of articulating our present state, how  were you able to pull off the veneer and not fall into the trap of glossing over the 'dirt' in our society, but actually baring open for all to see the 'real' side of India. Are you also writing or creating keeping in mind the dire need to articulate our society and get people to finally see the gaping holes in a rapidly decaying culture?

Apologies if this comes off as rambling, but would love a  conversation around this. Subhadra in one of the episodes speaks about the Ganpati festival and what it means to the people celebrating it. It made so much sense and Rajshri, I believe took it to next level. Wanted to know whose idea it was? It was a brilliant monologue! Hey Varun,

No questions, just a big thank you for writing Masaan. It is my favourite movie of all time, and I've lost count of how many times I've watched it now.

Thank you! @Varun - Whens the next aisi taisi democracy show happening?

@ Vikramaditya Motwane - thank you for Udaan and Lootera. that's all.  Hello Vikram and Varun.

I love how mythology is used in the show. Which chracter from Indian Mythology so you find the most interesting and why? In retrospect, what things would you change about Season 1? This is to both of you. (Don't say nothing) Vikram, a lot of the outdoor night scenes used had a lot of obviously yellow lighting. Apart from the obvious street lighting aesthetic was that a deliberate creative choice to set a particular tone? While I loved Sacred Games, I found it disappointing that every time a female character gained any importance, she was killed off. Can we not have that future seasons? What was the overall budget of SG ? How does it compare to a typical Bollywood movie ? Hey, also I was wondering. In writing for the show, where did you look for inspiration? What films, stories, serials if any helped shape your idea for telling these stories?   Why are you not directing season 2?
Why did Ganesh kill chota badariya? Hi Vikram, Varun! Here are the questions:


1.
Many artists keep to themselves and their team so that their creative process is not diluted. You on the other hand are pretty much active on social media and also end up acknowledging reviews, fans, criticism. Does the response help you change your process or would you rather stick to your conviction?

2.
Hey Varun, since you are back in the stand up, do we expect a special from you? 
Also who are your favorite upcoming stand up comics from India? I loved the series and it's many layered narratives . When can we expect the next season ? Hi Varun & Vikram, Excellent job with the script and direction. I wanted to know Who wrote the dialogues for the part Anurag directed?  1. Can you talk about your inspirations for the visual look of the series? I feel Sacred Games really embraced the dingy, 3rd world tube light lighting prevalent in India. 

2. Does the director take HDR into consideration while planing the shots with DP? Your favorite TV show and movie? Hi Varun,

Will we any comments on recent Indian political history in the show?
May be between the period 1995-2015? I was wondering why Gaitonde's Hindi would have a North Indian accent as opposed to having a strong Marathi slant given his background and upbringing. Was it considered? Which is your favourite TV Show other than Sacred Games? Hi everyone, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap aside, who would be your individual choices for directing the two segments? And can a director affect a tv series significantly given they have tight scripts to follow? Bhagwan mein vishwas karte ho? 

How different or similar is your personal concept of god to the one portrayed in the series?  

 What precautions do you take while writing for the present Indian audience?  

Great work guys it was a liberating experience to have prolonged engagement with realistically portrayed fleshed out characters. Never understood how people get so emotionally involved with a sports team they have no connection with untill I saw the quality product you have delivered and felt a little vicarious pride to be part of the context. Sad to say havent felt this patriotic in recent years.  Was there an option to cast anyone else apart from saif Ali khan as the main lead ? hello , 
 why are you not directing season 2 ? 
Any other book you would like to adapt ?
And why was the relationship with parulkar changed from the book ?
Why was chota badariya killed?

 Hello Vikram, since Varun Grover's razor-sharp satirical commentary on religious fanaticism is exceptionally well, will we see him directing a few episodes in next season?  If Gaitonde is dead, how is he narrating his story?
Edit: A word Have either of you been following fan theories that have going around? How was the experience of making the show with the knowledge that there is no CBFC involved? Did you have any 'quality control' from Netflix side? 1. what guidelines does netflix pass to directors for a series?
1. 
1. what are the ""must haves"" from netflix in the show or each episode? Hi. Big fan of you both. Any chance you would collaborate on a comedy caper (Series or movie)? Almost all the best TV series or even movies are inspired from best selling novels. Does that mean if you want to be a movie script writer, you should probably learn to be book writer ?

Varun defies this statement but is it true in general ?  Off-topic..

What are your fav places to relax and enjoy the vibe? What about script screenplay set design etc?  Favourite Mumbai snack ?  Which disease is Sartaj suffering from? I am really shocked to see Radhika Apte dead in the very 7th episode .. Don't you think her character should be little bit longer ? 
Varun & Vikram i want both's perspective on it  Will you be including Aadil or Mary in the next season? How has the international response been to the show ? I mean do you have some statistics like % of international viewers from Netflix ? top film mate cheers keep it up Varun What level of improvisation happened compared to the script? And comparing the two directors. Hi question goes to both of you, Gaitonde is dead in the first episode then how is he narrating the story? When you guys have specially shown the build up of phone conversation between the two characters. I think you could have find an other way out also Why did Gaitonde kill his mother? What did he actually think of his father? Shit! I missed it! why saif ali khan as a lead ? are you going to reveal sartaj and megha's back story anytime soon? Is there any similarity between the character of Gaitonde and real life Don Chhota Rajan?

Isa = Dawood...? Spin off sartaj singh?  Varun, considering how you've always been an advocate of a gender equal society and been a feminist in general, and taking into account how big an impact hit movies and shows have on its watchers, do you think the use of expletives involving women could have been avoided? Did Netflix impose any sort of restrictions on Sacred Games at a writing/production stage like Amazon Prime Video does? What’s the funniest meme  you have seen about the series? What is the most practical, sensible advice would you have for aspiring writers with no experience in film in this changing media landscape? Hey Varun, a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? There is a character Aadil in the book, which was missing from Season 1 , will that will character come in upcoming season?
And what should we all expect that will come in season 2 .. which will help us fulfill our hunger for season 2 till it comes ? Loved the show, especially the way it was written. It was great to see  the characters speak the way a regular person in their situation would.  But do you ever feel that the ever so creative Indian *gaalis* overshadow the content sometimes?    Hi Sir, Congratulations on the success of Sacred Games. Will both of you also collaborate on Udaan2? When can we expect it to hit theatres?  Was Saif Ali Khan your first choice for Sartaj? I also heard that Saif was the only actor in the whole cast who has read the book? Do you think reading the book gives the advantage to portray the character? Hey guys, I asked Varun the same question last time, so I will spare him this time around.

So Vikram, what's your writing process like, what kind of hours you put when working on a script, how much inspiration you take from your daily surroundings and conversations and what's the greatest screenplay ever written according to you.

Also no niceties for you guys! *Screams katekars name*
 
Nah, just kidding, you guys are awesome, making our movie industry save grace, keep up the great work. How were you guys able to keep up with both the Gaitonde's and Sartaj's narrative together? Was it already decided at the writing stage or was edited later as per the requirement of the episode? Are you guys planning to release **sacred games** Soundtrack?  A lot of hardwork has gone into the making of the show. How much time did it take from Script writing to promotions in total to launch the show on Netflix?

  


Goodluck for season 2. Take your time and make sure it at least as good as the first season or even better. :) What's your response to the courts verdict about you needing to be careful. Will this affect the quality of the show in any way. Hey guys,

Did you all have full creative independence regarding the story and all the scenes shot or were there any restrictions that Netflix put on you or something that you guys thought this was too far.

Btw enjoyed the show and can't wait for the next season.

Edit: The slow creeping shots that setup most of the scenes were amazing, are those ode to your fav scenes in any movies? if yes then what all? Would love to work with this creative team. We are at dire need to change the television content currently broadcasting all over Zee, star, Galaxy and universe.The success of Sacred Games be the bedrock of the new age of Indian Televised Entertainment!
This script is pretty worked on and the scenes are beautifully portrayed. Kudos to the team for the venemous show #sacredgames #IndiaTVRevolution What would you advice amateur screenplay writers who want to make a name for themselves in the future? When will Netflix anounced season 2 or more accurately why hasn't Netflix anounced season 2 ? After the response you've received for the show , how mature do you think Indian audience has gotten over the years? And do you think at this pace, sacred games will be just an average show in the time to come?  Why did gaitonde ended up buying a rolce royce instead of that red car  If someone got a good script how to pitch it to you guys? were you satisfied with the line of dialogue delivered by gaitonde after cuckoo's death where he says ""main bhagwan ke bhi upar h""?

that looked bit odd to me. How's Nawazuddin Siddiqui with nudity Vikram your favourite Black Mirror episode.?? Sorry but the hindi translation seemed a bit off for some crucial moments.

Like when Sartaj or Katekar says आई झवली, hindi captions are हे भगवान. These don't carry the weight of the expression. Do you mind working on this? Found the last episode confusing. It didn't really clear anything for me. I failed to understand so much in season finale. Hopefully next season will clear what's going on. Hey guys, great work on Sacred Games. Thanks for the AMA!

I have a different sorta question - as someone who consumes a lot of Indian movies and series, we've all fantasied about writing a better story/screenplay than some of the crap we see. I know it's much harder to actually write a good story than to dream about it, but what would your advise be to someone who wants to write an original story/screenplay? How should one get it ""out there"" once they are done? Is the best course of action to write a small story and shoot a budge short film? Or just submit stories to the studios directly? This is assuming that a full-time course like AIB First Draft, etc aren't viable right now.  Any of your regular (favourite) food or drink joints where I can find you ? 😛 I am currently reading the book after watching the TV series. I found that a lot of storylines have been changed. For example Cuckoo is a very minor character in the book, Sartaj is not so honest among others. What was going in your mind when you started writing for the show? What motivated you to make some changes? One or two examples will be very helpful!! I just loved the show. Can't wait for the next season. So here are my questions - 

1. Was Saif your first choice for Sartaj Singh? 

2. Did you expect the Bofors line to become  such a big controversy? How did you find Rahul Gandhi's response?

3. Why did you choose Netflix over other online streaming platforms? How was the experience? 

 How much liberty were you given by Vikram Chandra in visualising his book? Did you need approvals from him?  The main villian's every dialogue was very cringy, was it supposed to be so or you guys couldn't find someone else. Hey Vikram, will Bhavesh Joshi Superhero end up saving the city from nuclear attack? You two have been in the industry for a long time now and might have watched many an artist such as yourself still struggling to 'make it' (doesn't necessarily mean creating something as tight and amazing as SG on a scale as large as Netflix, but I hope you get the idea). Is there anything that you did different from these people and would like to share it with young people who are looking forward to entering the industry and beginning their journey as artists?  The fact that Gaitonde killed his mother has left me bewildered. Why did he kill his mother?  What did he actually thought of his father?  for me the best actors were parulkar katekar cuckoo nawajuddin. Why is there no dubbing to other Indian languages? Do add Tamil Varun, who wrote the Marathi dialogues? Some of those puns were really good. I think Saif Ali Khan aka Satraj plays a very little role and its kind of biased to see his name appear first in the name of the actors. Nawazuddin Siddiqui's name should have appeared first. Saif was awesome as a sardarji, can we expect sequel? Great work on the show! Can't wait for season 2.
How can more ""bold"" films and TV shows be brought into mainstream media?  How should aspiring screenwriters, who think they can write a web-series like Sacred Games go about it? Who should they approach? Is Trivedi dead or alive Udaan is one of my fav movies of all time, watched it when i was in college, emotionally attached to it.. thanks for it.

will you release the sacred games OST? How could gaitonde crush the heads of both his mother and the man at the same time Hey, Varun and Vikramaditya! Congratulations on the series. I enjoyed it, but it was more wonderful for me to see how much my parents and grandparents and so many of their friends enjoyed it too. 

What has the response felt like for you so far? Do you also find the show appealing so much to unexpected demographics because of the very specific picture of Mumbai it paints?  Is babaji planning a nuclear attack so that he could predict it and proclaime himself as a godman Where some of the soundtrack in Sacred games similar to soundtracks of Game of Thrones or am I the only one feeling so? @Varun - Kamra, Rathee or you - who will ""called out"" by the BJP first? (cue your youtube comment banter!)

PS - Stellar work guys - have rewatched it twice already! Q1: I feel the character of Sarjat is very lame. He is very mediocre. Doesn't react on time when it is much needed and always ends up in a goofed up situation. Why is it made like that?

Q2: How many seasons can we expect for Sacred Games? I am looking forward to the next one after the cliff hanger by the last episode. When can we expect second season? Is this verified by the mods of r/india or anything? Q1. Did the liberation from censorship actually overwhelm you? like a small kid in a fair?
Q2. What sort of treatment from Indian media were you expecting after the release? Vikram will you be completely involved in the second season? Also have you guys already planned on how many seasons this show will go on for. Huge fan of the show. Congratulations to the whole team.  Hey varun and vikram big fan of the show.


1.My question is will you be loyal to the books written by the author for future seasons or take it another direction entirely? 

2.Are there any plans to bring more such content on netflix from your team specifically in the near future?

3.Were there any  stars you approached before going for saif ali khan for the role of Sartaj?

Thanks for doing this AMA ,you guys deserve all the praise you are getting for this amazing show,kudos! I am curating an Online Treasure Hunt themed on Sacred Games. Would you like to check out the hunt and possibly collaborate to make the levels even more intriguing? What are the pros and cons of working on a series as compared to working on a movie project. What do you prefer and why? When will be season 2 in production? Hey Vikram, Congratulations on the whole series. I loved it. Watched it  twice and would soon go for a third round. Have so many questions but chose 5-6 of them for here. 

How did you decide to switch between the two timelines ? Or was it specified pretty nicely in the book ? 

P.S Posting other questions in further comments.  What's your favorite English TV show of all time?  A question for both of you,

Which books are you reading now ? Was it liberating for you guys? Because you didn't have to deal censorship and all. It felt realistic with the gaalis and the episodes with cuckoo and her sexuality. I really feel this is a benchmark for the coming Indian TV shows or movies. Hi Vikramaditya, I have been following your career for a while and have seen some of your work (Udaan, Lootera and Sacred Games). A common theme has been that emerges is the internal conflict that all your protagonists seem to face (Eg. Ranveer in Lootera, Saif in SG, Rajat in Udaan). Do you do this intentionally to provide layers to these characters or would you say its a fair representation of how humans really are? Looking forward to seeing more of your work! 

And Varun, your Padmaavat stand up piece on youtube has become my go to video when i feel stressed. Thank you for that!  Varun, what was it like adapting from an existing book? How was it different? Did it feel constrained at times? How did you pick the elements you wanted to add/ delete? For the underworld bits, did you take from existing writing on Bombay's underworld? 

 Dear r/vidushak,

You're the best and I've been a fan since much before GoW, Masaan, DLKH etc.

Your clarity of thought is just astounding and I love how you're never ready to take a stand and never late to apologize or learn if you're wrong.

Since I have to ask a question, I'll ask what your favorite Twitter handles are? (Sorry it's just the first question that came to my mind) /u/vidushak, what do you enjoy more, working on your stand up routines or working on movies/shows like Massan, Sacred Games? 

Saw you a couple of times in Mumbai doing stand-up a few years ago, its always fun to watch you :) Some general questions on writing.

Q1. When you people write something original, do you first write in form of a story and then adapt it to a screenplay, or directly a screenplay?

Q2. When you start writing, what is the thing you already have in your mind?? The total conflict? the story gist? Or just like you start and try building the characters and situations with a blank mind?

Q3. What is the difference in approach in writing an adapted screenplay (Sacred Games,  Lootera) to a completely original and fresh one (Masaan, Trapped)?


Thank you. First of Vikram and Varun, great great job you guys. SG has reached cult status. Which new actor has impressed you the most?  Varun ,when did you start writing and what things helped you at the Beginning? How does the budget compare to say an Indian production? Hello everyone .. my question is from Varun ji .. how you're feeling after the great success of the Sacred Games its kind of Indian GoT ! 
How is your experience to co-write the story of not so successful Novel do you expected this much success of serial during writing it ? for u/vmotwane,

After watching the final cut, did you feel that there was something that you could have directed better or with your own perspective in anurag's story arc ? First of all thank you for taking a much needed step of creating a tv series which has all the elements of what a large audience always wanted.

I have two questions here.

First, what is the reception to the show in the industry. Do you think the reception of the show with the audience would help move the money to this kind of content or is this genre still too niche for the industry to swivel towards it.

Second, how is it working with another director. Were there parts where you (question for Vikramaditya) and Anurag Kashyap where  had difference in opinion and how do you come to conclusion to it.

Lastly, thank you again for making this show. I hope to see the third baap real soon. Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate. 

Also a request I don’t think KD will come in the show but please please put him in one episode as a flashback or something, that guy has a potential for a tangent show all by himself.  Is the home minister trying to defend the attack or he is cooperating with the attackers What's your take on nepotism ruling bollywood? Why are you contributing to nepotism by employing someone who has a series of flops? Will a non-star parivaar actor get a chance after so many flops?

My question is - 
Most of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who’re young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? 

Also, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!
Thanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.
If you have more questions ...well read the book :)

Its about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that

Its also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...

its about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..

i'd welcome questions on those lines too... I’ve heard from my friends who’re at MBBs that it’s not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions -- 

> Hi Ashok! First of all, a big Thank You. People like you who tirelessly work towards betterment of downtrodden and society at large are the real (unsung) heroes.

> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.

How would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.

Also are there any CSR projects that are looking into this? Hi Ashok, welcome to reddit! What is your experience working with public servants? Do they cooperate? Do they hinder progress? Did you have to work closely with governments?  Many people are not aware about PEP, how do you create awareness about that ? What are your thoughts on legalization of prostitution in our country?

*This is just an announcement. The AMA thread will be posted by the guest at 2 PM tomorrow.*


",kash_if," This is huge. Well done! Good one Mods! 
Please someone ask her what her plans for entire India would be like in education, as I may not be online around that time.  Very cool and epic Would there be a chance to ask our questions prior to the start? Time constraints here make it hard to be online at that time. okay that's nice. Do kejriwal next please noice! well done mods Great job mods. Here are two of my questions in case I don't make it online then:

1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?

2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Wow. Amazing.

RemindMe! 14 hours  My questions to Atishi:

1. AAP has done wonderful work in primary education. What is your vision for professional and higher education?
2. In view of the looming threat of AI taking over most lower level jobs in about a decade, what is your vision for education which will make students employable in the future? Why is the Marlena last name suddenly getting dropped everywhere? This is GRAND! This is so huge. Good work!!!  u/kash_if where is the AMA post? Woah. This is great!! Looking forward to it. [deleted] Will you become the Education Minister of India in a future coalition government?  To Atishi 


1. What changes does India need in higher education, professional courses?


2. What freedoms should parents provide their children to develop as a better person?


3. Does the super costly schools(where mostly the very rich study) teach something unique that is a challenge to bring to the government schools?


4. What do you do when you are not working for education or advising AAP?


5. What message do you want to give to the youth in their 25 to 35 years of age? Continue working, take courses? anything you want to say


6. What are your long term plans for education if you keep doing what you are doing for a decade or more?


7. Is the AAP government working on any promising long term solution for pollution? Are the kids motivated to take charge?

8. Have you been approached by any other state or center to do your work at a larger scale? We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Shit 
I saw this too late...
I really wanted to interact :/"
AMA,I'm a Syrian-Christian. Ask Me Anything.,74,cnx0jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnx0jb/im_a_syrianchristian_ask_me_anything/,163,"I'm a Syrian-Christian Malayali who wants to answer any questions you can ask, from any and every corner of India. AMA

Denominational questions highly encouraged!",simsim1000," How does your church came to be? I mean what is the story behind it? 


Also does all sects of christianity have a fascination for conversion or its just few? What are the key differences between your church and the traditional catholic churches? Just language or are there any other core beliefs that differ? What is the difference between a regular (Catholic/Protestant...) and Syrian Christian? What are some some cliches that are used for Syrian Christian ? like we think Sikhs and Rajputs are brave, Brahmins are smart Muslims are violent something like these..are there any such prejudice/assumption about you. I don't know if I am making any sense. So if I understand correctly, your ancestry is more or less completely indigenous to India but you follow the canon of the church of Syria, correct? 1. What interesting historical/cultural places related to your particular denomination do you recommend visiting? Churches / monasteries / tombs / museums in Kerala or outside.
2. Any book recommendations regarding your people's history? Are you a religious person? Or just a cultural person? Is there a sizeable jewish population in Kerala? What's some must try food in your community? I want to convert to Latvian orthodoxy. I have too much 'kavorka'. what language do you prefer for prayers ?

Edit: Also want to know if Syrian Christian would want to go their roots and settle in Syria as this is the case for many region based minorities. Like in US there is a group of Zoroastrian who wants to settle in Iran mountain. Share that beef recipe bro അളിയാ! നാട്ടിൽ എവിടെയാ? I hope I'm not too late, but I stayed with a Syrian Christian family in Kochi with whom I don't have regular contact. They made me a lamb moilee with appams for brunch one morning and it is amongst the best meals I've had in my life. I need that recipe please, can you help? Syrian Christian food that I tried is by far and away some of the best Indian cuisine out there.

Also noted that the family I stayed with spoke of how they trace their conversion all the way back to Apostle Thomas' arrival and still observe some Hindu like practices. Very cool to learn how old the community is! Hi Simsim1000, Malayali of moplah background here.

My cursory knowledge of Kerala Christianity is through wiki surfing and the occasional interaction with my friends in the community. So, I have several questions that I never got satisfactorily answered before, hope I can ask them here:


1.	Is the Chaldean Christian community in Kerala considered part of Syrian Chrisitian Community , or is it completely separate? How different are they, and is there some overlap?
2.	When someone says they belong to Marthoma Church, do they mean the older St Thomas tradition, or something else?
3.	The history of the Kerala Christians church traditions are so rich and varied. For an outsider like me, it is difficult to get a grasp of the different rites/denominations/churches. Is it the same for someone within the church? If I were to ask the average joe/jane on the street, would he/she know only their churches history? Or would they have some knowledge about the other branches? Is this something you learn in your respective liturgical classes?
4.	May I ask if your head of the church resides in India, or the Middle East? How is the relationship between the practitioners in that country and the Kerala church? What's your opinion on gifts of the holy spirit/ speaking in tongues? Do you understand the Syriac language? What is your denomination ? On a scale of 10, where would you rate the Appam + More Kozhambu dish made in a Syrian-Christian home? Mate it's raining pretty heavily out there. Are you safe? [deleted] Do you believe in Jesus Christ as the son of God? Thanks for the diversity awareness exercise. It's a great thought. Wish more redditors from marginalized communities came forward with their own AMAs. I'm an atheist and I'm unable to grasp why any educated and rational being should just believe in imaginary constructs at a day and age where it's so easy to debunk or disprove them. Why are you religious? Hey, I’m also Syriac Christian! Living in US rn, but in India, I went to malecuriz dayro. What about you? Why do you have seperate churches for lower castes in Kerala? There is a main church and a small church in almost every place? Why is casteism still prevalent among Syrian-Catholics? So in your opinion it is normal and justifiable since it is Indian. I have seen people even the kids from sy-x families calling names of people in 80s who are low caste, there are seperate burial areas for the so called original syrian-xtians and low castes....all in the name of god and nowhere in the bible mentions about caste disparity or the xtians should follow the heirarchy. Do you support casteism? Yup , just read somewhere today that ISIS has  resurfaced in Syria once again ..were they ever curtailed ? ..Nd if possible can u shed some light on the Syrian civil war .with regards to  the timeline  .. Do you feel Ravi Shastri should continue as the coach? [removed] You mean a normal malayali christian? What are the different Kerala Churches within Syrian-Christian Framework? Let me ask the important question! Why are Syrian-Christians so hot? [removed] [removed]"
AMA,Hi India. I'm a Pakistani. AMA.,225,8w1kbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/,541,"The rules say a self-post should be of reasonable length, so here goes.

I'm 27, female, live in Pakistan. I work in marketing. I like Iced Lattes, A Song of Ice and Fire, and dogs.

I'd love to get to know Indians a bit more! Ask me your questions and don't mind if I ask you some back.

Aao baatay karay :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

Guys, I've not had anything to eat since breakfast. I'll have some dinner and hopefully come back soon!

It's been really cool talking to everyone so far :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, it's 11 pm here and I need to get some reading in before I head to bed! I'll catch you guys tomorrow if this thread is still interesting to any by that point!**

It was LOVELY speaking to everyone here! Indians sound amazing! Much love to you, all my Bhaarti Dost :D

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sporadically answering questions while at work today. Don't tell my boss, thanks. I think today will be the last day because we're gonna run out of questions soon :D

----------------------------------------------------------------
**LAST EDIT: Hi again! I feel like this has wound down, so I'm going to be off. Here's my last message:**

Thank you so much for making this AMA so much fun! I learned so much about India and I can relate to you all so much! I wish we could all get along better. We are literal kin, far back and deep down. I would love to come to India some day and meet people as lovely and hilarious and curious as you lot! And I'd love it if you guys came down to my country, too!

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

Namaste <3",WhereIsLordBeric," Do you place a newspaper as a separator between the wood and your clothes before filling your wardrobe/closet with clothes. 
If so. Why? 



 1. Why's your chai so weak?  
2. Is there a Pakistani equivalent of Bhai?  
3. So I just noticed you're a woman. [Rate me on a scale of 1 to 10](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTydOXAu7Fi1qcTvpN0QaG15uPhbHOD-nfuI11QbuisErM4n81K__Ry6szZ)

the eternal words!

 In India, our parents like to compare  their children with the infamous ""sharma ji ka ladka"". Does this also happen with you too? I don't really have a question, but I just want to appreciate how you've handled this ama so far. Polite replies to curt questions and humbly shutting off the people looking to stir things up. Cheers! I bet it’s a dude baiting for karma.  Hi! 


Could you recommend some Pakistani/Mughlai dishes that I may not have heard of before(as in, ones which are local-pakistani-in origin)?


Also, would you ever want to visit India? 


 How is life in Pakistan? How do your family see the fact that you're 27 and unmarried? They make a big fuss about this in India apparently. Is inbreeding truly common in pakistan (marry 1st or 2nd cousin)? Or it’s just the west trying to dmg the image of the pakistani people. * Have you ever been on a motorcycle?

* Have you been outside of Pakistan or do you plan to ( for travel etc ), to where?

* What's the popular smartphone brand in Pakistan?

* Do you follow muslim dress code? like wearing hijab and all
 Have you seen 'The Office' - US?  Was your family native Pakistani or they migrated from India. Mine migrated from peshawar.  I wanted to ask why do Pakistanis use 'ay' at the end, instead of 'e' or 'ein'? I had a Pakistani friend a looong time back, and type ""miltay hay"" instead of ""milte hain"". ""Baate karein"" to ""baatay karay"". Koi ladki patwa do aap :( What's the difference between you and average Pakistani woman? What are the things about Pakistan you love the most?

What about Pakistan do you dislike the most?

Favourite book? Do you guys have ""Karachi Biscuits""? What’s the dating scene like in Pakistan  I just came back from office and reading this, interesting conversation. Thanks for this. 

Have you seen TV series Mad Man, if you haven't, you must.

I am insanely fasinated by Pakistan, wo kehte hain na: Jis Lahore nahi vekhya, wo janmya hi nai. Ravi to chenab puchdaaaaa, ki haal ae satluj Da 😢 Keeping music and making football aside What else Pakistan does better than everybody else?  1) please recommend some Pakistani books/movies/songs.

2) how much history do they teach in school ? Do they teach about Mughals ? Indian freedom fighters? Would you ever eat bacon?  What were the expectations you had to live up to when growing up (studies, relationships, etc.)? What's your favorite -

1) Food

2) Song

3) Movie

4) Travel destination Welcome to Randia!

My Q is: What were/are you guys taught above Pakistan history and origin in History class in school. IIRC We (Indians) were/are taught about:
1. Ancient India: Birth of religions, Aryans and Vedic culture
2. Medieval India:  Maurya Empire, Delhi Sultanates, Mughals, Kingdoms in South India , etc
3. Modern India: Ideologies and contribution of many freedom fighters in independence of India ( Pakistan) from British India , Independence Movements, etc

History was quite extensive (and boring) for us. Since before 1947 you guys were technically Indians, so are you guys taught about only last 70 years or only about Muslim Movements or about today's India history.

I would really love to hear the answer of these questions from you.

Edit: She didn't answer my question yet but she answered a similar question here https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/_/e1sbo70 This is gold! Hey it was a very funny and wholesome thread. Thanks for doing the Ama here. You live in Pakistan or a foreign land ? And Hindi/Urdu bolni aati hai ? Have a few questions !

* Where in Pakistan you live ?
* Are you guys modern like Indians are ? Full gadgets freaks, sipping cappuccino in Starbucks slowly while reading on Kindle and reply to boyfriend's text on iPhone 10 ?
* Why ladies don't generally wear jeans or dresses etc ?
* Who is that famous chaiwala that won a modelling contract ? Can you complete the following?
Afridi chya aai chi **** How is the current political climate there? [deleted] [deleted] Sadly, the country is going to shit with the current govt. India isn’t what it used to be. If the current govt comes back to power, it would go from bad to worse.

It was great reading ALL of your answers. Thank you for the AMA. I really do hope this is not a fake account!

My question:
1. how often do the youth talk about politics? 2. What’s the Kashmir issue like to the general public? So you have read A Song of Ice and Fire. How would you rank the books in the series from most favourite to least favourite?

For me it is;

1. A storm of swords

2. A game of thrones

3. A dance of dragons

4. A clash of kings

5. A feast for crows.

 Damn a girl on reddit India and I miss out. Outta luck offline and online. Seriously I'm so sad about this irrational hatred seeded by politics between India and Pakistan. Like we're literally the same people.


Anyway, questions!

How is Pakistan for women? Many people have this impression that it's a really shit place for women.


How far do popular Islamic conservatism and sexism pervade up there? This may sound stupid, but how far are women pressured to wear burqas?


Does the average Pakistani dislike or appreciate India? Does this average person care that much about the whole Kashmir thing?


Do you consider yourself to be in the 1%? Can you talk a little about the middle class in Pakistan?


Can you talk a bit about the political situation in Pakistan completely honestly?


Since you like books, could you recommend some books for me to read? 


How far is the internet used in Pakistan? Is it widespread or elite-only?


How tf do your singers have such amazing voices. Atif Aslam is a legend.


Where do you encounter the most misogyny? Online or irl?


Is gaming a popular pastime in Pakistan as it is here? Do you game? If so, what do you play?


Is the 'Girls' School/Boys' School' thing prevalent in Pakistan as it is here to some extent?


What are some other tiny charming differences between our cultures? :D &nbsp;




Thank you for doing this ama, I've always wanted something like this! :) Not sounding creepy even though it is a creepy question but why are Pakistani women so cute ? Really dude I wonder how those cute girls ended there 😭 What did you have for lunch today? [deleted] Fuck I am late for this AMA. Can you answer these questions /u/WhereIsLordBeric 

1. Have you ever tried Ding Dong bubble gum? How were they? Their TV ad is one of the dankest thing I remember- featuring a cat who was dragged to *jungle* court by 2 lionesses because she stole their *ding dong* bubble gum.
  
2.  Are Square Cut chips similar to Lays potato chips? Their animated ad was pretty neat- a Pakistani cricket player hitting a sixer by using the *square cut* move.

3. Telefun sim card- how popular was it? Did you use it? Their animated ad was so shoddy in quality that the entire music+helpline number is still etched in my mind!
4. Ask me why and how do I know about all the stuff I mentioned above :D

Last but not the least- can I  join your Stardew Valley group?

 Have you seen any bollywood movies? If yes, which one did you like? How is life like for working women in metro cities of Pakistan? 


I loved watching zindagi Gulzar hai and hamsafar. And you guys have the best traditional fashion game! Noone does salwar kameez like you guys! :) I love your food, music, and art. 

Where do you live in Pakistan and how is life at your place? One Indian city you could live in  for the rest of your life. Can you help me get a Pakistani visa? I'm so curious about your country, only visiting it can end my curiousity. Do you like the wheel.of time series also? Are you sort of liberal or conservative? Hoping you are just an aam admi like me, what's the general perception in Pakistan about Indians?

 Furthermore, the hate based propaganda in either country stinks, what do you say? What's the one thing you feel that Pakistani people do really well that people of other nations can learn from? [deleted] If you had to recommend three pakistani movies, what would those be? God, I used to play this coke studio song to death on repeat a couple of years ago

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo) 1) Famous veg foods available over there ?

2) Do people also have  'log Kya Kahenge' mentality ? It runs deep in Indians and specially target towards women.

3) What do you think of women following religion considering most of religion are patriarchal in nature and always been used to control women ?

4) Do LGBT people organize Pride Parade in Pakistan ?

5) Is being atheist acceptable in Pakistani society or not ?

6) Are you from Sindh ?

I really love Karachi literature festival. They have awesome talks.    Where do you guys go on weekend trips. We Mumbai people go to Lonavala (google it), is there a similar place around Pakistani cities ? My sister is a BIG fan pakistani tv shows . She thinks they are whole lot better than indian daily soaps. Do you watch any? Is the culture totally different between two different regions (Urdu vs Punjabi speaking) like we have here, North and South India? Do you guys have OTP(one-time-password) there? I had a convo with a Pakistani gal 1-2 years back, she was clueless about it. Are you familiar with girlsatdhabas? What do you think of their initiative?  1. What's your beauty routine?
2. Do you have long hair? If so, do you henna it?
3. Epilators or wax? Not every Indian hate Pakistan or Pakistanis. What's about you guys/girls? Do most of you hate us like the media portrays?  Have you heard of or read Ibn-e-Safi?

As a kid I used to read his spy-thrillers (translated in Hindi) and loved them. Hi There,
Greetings, 

Could you refer some books referring the history of Pakistan. I already know the from the Indian Perspective and i feel a lot of people/Facts have been omitted.

Just one example i know of are the Ali Brothers who have been mentioned of significant importance for the Islamic community in Gandhi Book ""My Experiments with the truth during the Freedom Movement""

Would love to know how its been stated from Pakistan perspective.


Peace Take care.

Would love to visit and explore Pakistan one day(before i die). What kind of clothes do you wear 

A.  At work

B. At home 

C.  While out for shopping.   Are people there also told ""go back to India"", if they say something 'anti-national'? Do you think winds of winter will ever release? [deleted] Dude you just became popular 😂 What are some pakistani songs that you love to hear? (Don't forget to share ghazals) (Political) How has the perception of India amongst your age group and or peers changed in the past few years?  Are didi apki shaadi ho gayi ? Waha pe Mobile data ke plans kaise hai ? Yaha pe ab bahut sasta ho gya hai saare pakistani eese kiyu baat krte hein In case you're still answering:

1. How do you guys generally hang out with friends, partners, colleagues?

2. Sorry for the naivety (or if this is offensive), do you have bars? or just coffee or hukka joints?

3. ~~I saw 'Khuda Key Liye' and absolutely loved it. Any other stuff would you recommend?~~

4. Whats your take on Indian music? Is Bollywood as popular there as we think it is?

5. Do you know much about Indian film-stars? If yes, what would your kill, marry, hookup choices be?

Edit: saw the AMA chain, got answer to 3, unless you have a non-Punjabi film in place of Zinda Bhaag to recommend. what is the stance of women in Pak army? Does the Pakistan Punjab suffer from the same pesticide and farmer debt/suicide issue that occurs on the Indian side? Also, in that region do most people consider themselves as Pakistani or Punjabi if asked about their nationality? Is Urdu more widely spoken or Punjabi? pakistan may life kaise hai A Pakistani woman on reddit wow even my super nerdy friends don't use Reddit I am an Indian living in India, AMA about Pakistan. Why can't pakistani's cook vegetables without meat, why does it have to Aloo Gosht, Dal Gosht, Palak Gosht, Aravi Gosht, Tinda Gosht ? How do I lose my virginity? [deleted] [deleted] Which side of Pakistan are you from?

What's the reason and extent forb the hate Punjabis and Pashtuns have against each other?

P.S ; You're welcome to post on /r/IndiansGoneWild. We won't hold your nationality against you What do you look for in a guy ? What do Pakistanis think of South Indians? [removed] [removed]"

Do you guys think people from India are mostly green card scammers.

This is a serious question as I'm curious about this topic and I don't mean to be edgy lol. What's your perception on Modi's recent lockdown in Kashmir( ie prolonged curfew, arresting political dissidents and cutting of all landlines , mobiles and internet (

update - thanks for the super engaging session folks. if there is any more Q pls do post and I will answer later in the day/tomorrow. Do follow me on twitter - [https://twitter.com/haripyt](https://twitter.com/haripyt) and we can continue the convo there as well! ",hari_ganapathy," a stupid question:

how is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:

1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to ""customise"" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?
2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?
3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?
4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?


2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.


3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?

4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,
As someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.
We have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) 

Also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.

Anyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad. 

Suggestion - Improve the collection of preset activities 
 What is the motivation behind this project? Also, how did you get your first paying customers? [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Any job openings?  Are you hiring for Digital Marketing? Did the AMA finish? [removed] What are the payment options? Do you support National travel? Are you planning to in future? One thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from. If an agent tells me, up front, that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary, plus this is my x% profit, I'd gladly pay up - if I can verify that the items in the bill match whatever I see on [booking.com](https://booking.com) or [hotels.com](https://hotels.com) or wherever.

OTOH if an agent doesn't reveal this, I have no visibility on how much (and where) the travel agent is making his money, leading to the suspicion that I am being ripped off at every point. And if I have to constantly double-check his rates, I might as well do the same thing myself.

I and my family of 4 have made four international trips (two in Asia, two in Western Europe) over the last 9 years, and for the last European vacation we did all the research/online booking/visas ourselves. It was an exhasting/time consuming process, and I would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent. Hi Hari, I am Om. How do you do? Just checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest. 

Only thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel , where its your clients word against the hotel? And how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason. 

This is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business. Hi Hari, congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone. I didn't know you guys were THAT old! :-)  
My questions:

* Can you regale a story/anecdote/incident (from a customer's perspective) on how smooth the said PYT customer experience is?
* How has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today?
* What plans for the future? What should PYT customers should be excited about? Hey. This is the first time I've heard about the website. Had a look and it looks quite neat. 

How much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom plans?

What's an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year? My question would be at what point after founding the company did you observe a huge influx of customers and also what you think caused that influx ? How far you can provide customized experience in travel?  You will be able to find a very less common interest between an adventure traveller and a honeymooner. The thing that I'm not able to understand is, the interests & expectations of a traveller varies based on their purpose of travel.  [deleted]"
AMA,I bought Samsung m30s,6,dckqt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dckqt7/i_bought_samsung_m30s/,16,It's great and vfm. Got it for 11.6k. Ama if you have any questions and wants to buy this.,cooltechpec," I read it has headphone jack at the bottom and few have complained about it. What do you think about it? How did you get it for 11.6k, i got it for 12.6k man after discount? I too have bought it. But I am disappointed with its SAmoled screen. Even my 2 years old G5s plus has better colours and saturation than this. Do you know where can I tweak it? Some reviews mentioned heating issue and are dissatisfied with camera. Your thoughts? Screen time battery life? Does it have flamethrower? Who let the dogs out?"
AMA,"AMA: Not have much time left, Ask me Anything",490,8famwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8famwp/ama_not_have_much_time_left_ask_me_anything/,378,"Very new to Reddit, but I absolutely love this community. Diagnosed with Blood clot in my brain and many isochemtric foci that restricts blood and oxygen flow in my brain. Already had tumour. Doctor says that if you take tension anymore (which I am taking, because of my relationships and mental health issues), you will either get a stroke or partial/full memory loss.

Dont know how much time is left, as I have completely lost it - faith, believe system and hope and most importantly my comprehension ability.

I have done pretty good in my life till now and was one of the 1.5 lpm guy! 

Wanted to do few things before I completely dissappear - first online and then offline. Ask me anything. Roast if you want. 

EDIT: Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!

Get well soon ❤️ [deleted] we're all going where you are, any last words/advice you'd like to give the to us who are slowly dying?  If you come to Delhi, meet me please! I'd love to have a cup of coffee and try to understand how you are dealing with this. My problems are nothing compared to yours.  Rula diya bhai. 

Wishing you the best. 😘

Do update us when you have  conquered all this, which you are definitely going to do! 

Good luck. 
 Hugs. I am so sorry!

What were some best moments in your life?

Also, when was your first diagnosis?  bro , knowing when you will die is a gift which not many will have in their life. So make amends and don't forget to live RIGHT NOW. This reminds me of munnabhai mbbs movie actor jimmy shergil.

Anyway. Stay strong. Have fun. Sorry to break it to you but it's 1.6 lpm, not 1.5 lpm. hi, i hope you have people around you to help you deal with all the bad stuff,

I keep joking around about how i wanna kill myself, posts like these open up my eyes to how surreal death would actually be.

dont really have a question specifically, but if something, what has been the best advise someone ever gave u?

you have my best wishes Hang in there tight buddy! All the best.

* Do you have a bucket list?

* When was your disease diagnosed?

* What happened to your relationship? (Sorry if it is too personal; you can skip it)

* How did you diagnose it? Were there any symptoms?

* Apart from the risk of stroke and mental issues (which I suppose is because of the grim situation), does the disease debilitate your functioning?

I understand this is a tough situation, but boy you are a fighter. This very AMA is a testimony to that.. Not a lot of people can do it. This community will be here for you when you need it. 420 Blazeit.

Anyways, what do you want to do for the rest of the days. Also any regrets? Bhai, this is the time to touch as many lives as possible.


You have already said you have been called dick & arrogant, try to live peacefully & inspire folks around you with a positive outlook.


Even to have one *(additional)* person look up to you makes a lot of change. With nothing to fear, you can reach your true potential. Start distributing good memories around man. I'm so happy to read that you have no regrets. In the current juncture of my life, I'd probably die with a ton. This is inspiring me to do shit and not waste time.
&nbsp;

I hope you can beat it but if you can't then I hope it is a painless & peaceful exit. Keep fighting! When are you planning to see Avengers: Infinity war?

Stay strong bro What suggestion/advise would u give to a 17 year old? *One day we will die, snoopy*.

*True,but on all the other days we will not*.

https://in.pinterest.com/pin/208221182750317976/ What's plan of action now? Can I/we help you get any of bucket list wish fulfilled? Best of luck mate. 

What were the symptoms and how did it get diagnosed?  Ok. Knew a guy who had a brain tumor. The doc. gave him max one month to live. Not wanting to disappoint his parents, he got married against advise of all friends. It's been 10 years since. He has two kids, and still working as of this day....   


The brain not receiving oxygen is a serious issue. But I would say don't lose hope or give up easily. Ultimately, you are the best judge, however, having a positive attitude will give you the best shot at life.

Good luck. What's the main cause for this disease??

What medical test should be taken to diagnose this? Kuch Ni hoyega tujhe Don't have any questions. But just want to wish you the best. Sending you a virtual hug bro!

Get well soon :) I found this post 

This is my cousin Gareth. He lost his leg to cancer 3 years ago and now has 15 lung tumours and is terminally ill at age 26. Last week he completed the London Marathon.  [The link is at the bottom of the post]

I’m not suggesting you to go for marathons but at this time you could do things you wouldn’t dream of.

As it was mentioned in Dark Knight Rises, “How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear of death.”

This is your race against time. This is the right moment to challenge life.

One last thing. You run, you fly, you fall, you crash but you dare not stop up till the end of your time.

 Sigh....first of all if what you have mentioned is all true, then it's really sad that an asset like you might be leaving us in the near future. My deepest condolences. 

This world is weird in the sense that those who want to die cannot die, those who deserve to die, don't die..but those who really want to live and are willing to contribute to this world regardless of whether for themselves, for their families, their kin, or for humanity as a whole, often end up getting the short end of the stick. From what you have told us about yourself, you also seem to be such a guy. If there is any supernatural entity overseeing this world, then I curse such a megalomaniacal but irresponsible and impotent being for playing such games with us. It really pisses me off how almost no theist ever curses and blames this guy. Thankfully, I gave up on such an entity long time ago, and am happy being an atheist now. When there is no sense of security of being protected by such an almighty being, there is no disappointment at times of peril and grief too. When there is no hope, how can there be any hopelessness and fear at the moment of crisis?? How can there be any sense of betrayal from such an indifferent entity at such times?? There will only be peace of mind knowing that atleast you didn't waste your precious time in life by praying to such an apathetic and egotistical entity. Since you have already given up on him, I hope that your last moments shall also not be filled with such a sense of disappointment and betrayal. 

Though, if possible, try your best to overcome it and get well. But if not, please live your remaining moments to their fullest. Have no regrets. If you are still a virgin (hope not)...get some snu-snu.😎 If there is some cuisine you might want to try, go for it. Don't worry about the lynchers even if it's beef. You can always visit North East or mallu-nation. If there is any place you would like to visit, don't stop yourself. If there is a drink/weed you would like to drink/smoke, don't hold yourself back. Please consult the doctor before you try to pull any stunt though. But, basically live the rest of your life for yourself. BE SELFISH. 

Sorry for the long post, but that's pretty much what I wanted to say. I just got a bit emotional reading your story. 
Also looking at your report, it seems like you were diagnosed with cholesterol which might be the cause and precursor (just pseudo-sciencing here). That serves as a warning for me to get into shape too...Have been gaining some 'tond' recently. 😰 Blame these: 🍝🍕🍔🍟. Kudos to your spirit.Hats off to your attitude.At the outset,I wish to extend strength and a bearhug from my side.I hope and I sincerely do,that you find peace with your existence and with all the going arounds of this world,things that we all have little control over and yet besiege our mental spaces because hell who doesn't want a better world.

Stumbling upon this AMA,trying to grasp what you might be feeling now, this makes me look upon my life like Carl Sagan would have looked upon the pale blue dot of Earth from space,small,petty,filled of meaningless trivial rants,and yet to understand how I could make a teeny difference in the right direction for the good of people around me and myself.

You my brother(I hope I don't come across as pretentious,because well we don't know each other)
are an inspiration.Your mere act of admittance of your current situation and the fact that you would want to give back to the society,to kids,(I read your other comments),is testament to your awesomeness.

I wish upon you these lines from Dinkar,


भुजाओं पर मही का भार फूलों सा उठाये जा,

कंपाये जा गगन को, इंद्र का आसन हिलाये जा,

जहां में एक ही है रौशनी,वह नाम की तेरे,

ज़मीं को एक तेरी आग का आधार है साथी !


 Bhai, Job ke liye reference milega ?

Just kidding!

Hey man, all the best for what the future holds for you. Hope this phase passes soon and you come back stronger than you ever were. Don't count yourself out yet. 

As they say, It ain't over till it's over! You got this! I really like your spirit and hope you live the most before cycle of birth and death takes you along.

\- What are top things you would do if born again? First of all, my condolences. What do you plan to do now? Have you already quit your job? I'm sorry to hear that man. I really hope your recover soon! How did your family reacted to it? And is 26 too old to pursue my masters in Europe(My dream)? Get well soon brother!  I thought long and hard about what to write, but I'm at a loss for words. So here - *hugs*. Sending you lots of good vibes telepathically :) what advice would you give to someone who has failed, or feels like he's failed in every aspect of life Sales Job Hai kya,?  Have you seen Randy Pausch's Last lecture video?  Try giving something to others. It can make you feel better.
Teach others what you know. Especially where it can make a difference in their lives.  bro.. girlfriend hai toh break up karo. go travel. everyone you know will bum you out. dont spend all your money, just incase you survive.

.. and most importantly batao kya chahiye.. russian, israeli ya desi? randia will fund this.

better yet.. go to thailand or something. get aids or die trying Here I am slaving away, losing body and mind. There you, positive attitude against all odds. If you are inNumbai, PM. As someone who has lost brothers and sisters at a young age, please make sure your family is mentally prepared.  Serious: people say meditation helps to calm the mind down. Have you tried it? If yes, did it have an impact? Really want to know? Much love from Bengaluru♥️. You're a fighter even if you shed tears, remember that. Spend each moment on your terms. See you on the other side, though I hope you don't cross over for a long, long time. Overall, be Brilliant and beautiful in whatever you do.
Question(s):
 Any tips for an 18 year old inexperienced twat like myself who's about to go to college? 

What were your fondest moments and who do you want to spend most of your time with now that you have this sense of finite time left?  Big hugs ♥️ things will be okay brother, please PM if you're in Bangalore or Bombay, would love to meet you over a cup of coffee 🙂 Too late to the ama but OP, I think I have an interesting idea. Go to malls, meet random people and have interesting conversations with them. You can have a placard/tshirt describing your condition and your desire to have interesting conversation.  Once you are comfortable with this, start a youtube channel so that everyone can cherish your memories.

May be good fun. Since you were a 1.5 lpm guy, i guess you must have some savings. What are you gonna do with it?

Also, how hopeful are you in our country's future? Do meditation. Try yoga. Shirshasana/sarvangasana improves blood flow to brain. But consult doctor if you can do it. Daru piyega? i.e. if you're in Bangalore I am currently a neurology resident. You can PM me if you have any questions regarding the diagnosis.  Ek sawaal hai \- how was your lifestyle \- good or bad. If bad, where do you think you screwed up? It can be a good wake up call for a lot of 1.5 lpm guys here. And here I was like - 
""Ki aisa mere saath kyun hota hai"".?

Kudos man to you and your courage. :)

I lost a friend not a close one to cancer and I regret meeting him for the last time, due to some misunderstandings between me and him. I have flashbacks of it.

Just one thing I want to say, Go out and meet every person you know and wish to see for the one last time. These experiences can change people life's for Good.

Enjoy your life and Go out there and Kill it.
Aur haan, Tension na le. You will be fine.

Any regrets you have in your life?  [deleted] hey, good to see you holding up.
now that you are here in this point of your life, what do you think about yourself, as a human being? do you think what we are doing on our little earth, matters in this vast, unlimited, expanding universe? 

As a single individual human, merely being a worthless cog of the Human Engine, in which others are spearheading us into our evolution, and still we don't know anything about the cause of our existence, or where we are headed, or does it matter at all, I many times find myself lost in these thoughts. What do you think actually matters? Driving on the Highway the society built for us, or making our own path?

What do you think about the faiths and religions you did/did not followed?  Is it incurable? To accept your own end is as brave as it can get. 

Who knows, maybe you find something else on the other side. 

Hope you have the best time you can in what remains!  Hey man, no questions, just wanted to say all the best! You will come out of this. And if things go South, please don't delete your account. [deleted] Please stay and fight till the end friend.  Hopefully you will be back after a miracle.  Bro, Try yoga, Baba Ramadev ne bola hai Yoga se sab accha hoga.
And If you want chill pill? PING ME! Don't really have anything to ask but good luck with your recovery and keep in mind, miracles can and do happen!  Virtual hug to you. Keep fighting till end. Hey OP , you may not like it but could you make  a series of videos how you perceive life-death-future you or anything you wanna share . Upload it on youtube May i ask when you realized there was a problem and you need a diagnosis? Can we take precautions with checkups in some way? Aur God bless you bhai. I don't want to annoy you with my questions. I will gift you this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7lyYoi2dpE), This is the song which I listen when I am most stressed and drained out.

Theek ho jao bhai, zindagi lambi hai! My cousin died because of blood cancer. He went on and said sorry to all those people who he hurt or said something in past. They all forgive him for the things he has done. He died very peacefully with no regrets about his life.  How many real life friends do you have? How are they helping out these days have you considered donating your organs? you look like the prime candidate for donation, all organs intact, no infectious diseases, and in prime of youth How are you man? Hope you got some good news. Where's your medical proof that you are diagnosed with all that?  You seem really in hurry, even I had to type this message at 1000 w/m. To avoid the chance to roast him the last time. 

.

A guy who will be deep roasted in few days is asking for a roast. 


PS: How was that?? I need feedback if you there....... [deleted] Since you're aware of your situation, are you doing drugs? I guess it would be easier for you to get into it.  Aw shucks man, thats really sad to hear. How does complete detachment from everything around you feel?
 Sorry to hear about you- I hope you can fulfill all your dreams !!
I would suggest make some YouTube videos to teach further so the knowledge never dies !! 
 What are your favourite movies, books, shows, songs etc? We'd love to know! 

Also, hopefully they help you cope with it better. Reading your comments, it feels like you have very few regrets (I may be wrong) and that's something not a lot of us can achieve. Good on you for living the way you wanted to! 

Hopefully your time here has been fun and continues to be. Cheers!

* Just read that you're going back to your hometown to spread some education! There is no greater joy than giving back, and you're one of the very few who will achieve it! So that's really great on you man! Did you had a good time? Hang in there bud and if possible stay strong for your loved ones.I had a friend who knew his time was coming soon and it was heart wrenching.


 Pilani dude?  of all the things i have seen on this subreddit even this site,this make me sad. all i hope is u get well soon.i am not a religious person but reading this i said help him god. How old are you? Are you married? Fuck tension. Let's grab a beer.  Stay Strong Bro ! Totally at loss of words. Feel better today!! Kinda feel happy for you in a wierd way. Knowing I'm stuck in never ending cylce of 8-5 college plus wards plus never ending studies plus bleak prospect of pg entrance plus childhood issues. 

Sorry man. I don't mean bad on you. Have a good afterlife.  Hey sorry for your condition. I want to know how you got the job at UN? Through contacts or are you from a really good university? How old are you? How is your family taking it? Dear /u/aadhaatom
It's not over until it's over. You need to believe that this can pass and you need to fight. And fight harder than you ever have. Tell death to fuck off. If you have to go down, go down fighting! have you thought about saving your sperm? Isn't Megavac an option? I am so sorry bruh, _hugs_ 😭 Adopt a puppy,go to an orphanage and spend time with the kids,go to an old age home and spend time with grannies.Do sewa at a nearby gurudwara/church/mosque/temple (including cleaning shoes if required)...And finally,get laid. I'm so sory, OP. I hope you get well soon, hopefully :). How are your parents dealing with this? What is your biggest regret? Not losing hope. Not having it either (right now) Take care Bhai. My best wishes with you and your family. This is terrible. Hugs and hang in there!

Make a blog or vlog of you teaching kids if you can, you’ll leave behind some crazy amazing motivation for a lot of folks. And keep posting here, I’d be happy to see you pop in every month :) if your doctors are absolutely certain there is no way out, do a complete fast from food for 30-40 days with just minimal water intake. There are magical powers in fasting. I can guarantee you will be cured.  Just a suggestion for increasing you lifespan a few more decades.......get a death mask done. Search it up if you don’t know......im 16 and have decided to do it whenever the time comes. Hopefully you dont need it this time though. And best of luck. Dont want to offend.

But facing the reality

Do you have the urge to travel your heart out? So sad. How old are you? Are getting cremated or buried? Did you choose your coffin or urn? What was that like?  Kudos for dealing with it in this way. I hope you get to live longer. Desire to live and trust in medical can go a long way. And regardless, I hope you enjoy the rest of your life. :) 

Would you like to recommend any movies, games or apps that you absolutely love ? 
Or perhaps you could also share your music playlist ? 

Thanks. You are a strong man.  You still have to be optimistic bro. Just believe in yourself at least ? First of all, kudos on answering so many questions. 
Secondly, best of luck on your endeavors. You are someone who must have a different perspective on a lot of things now. What's something very few of us know about life that you have learnt because of your condition? I  mean you are dying and I might die a little bit late but I'm dying a little bit everyday anyway. Do you see the importance of doing what you want to do over doing what other people want you to do? Would you advise me to take the leap of faith and chose the career that I love or should I stick to the safer option that would get me good salary and  wheatish woman from shaadi.com? You're braver than I can ever aspire to be. Hang in there. Big hugs xx.  I'm trying to imagine myself in your position. I would say, you should think of the things you felt you always missed, and try to make your peace with those things.

If you think you'll miss your family, spend time with them. 

If you feel you want an apple design award, see the inner motivation/desire. Why do you want that award? Recognition? It represents Professional Success for you? 

Let me tell you, the best design is what comes naturally to you. No white guy/Jony Ive/Tim Cook living a 1000 miles away, who doesn't know your life/where you come from, can judge your work. Just draw/paint/design for yourself, remove the need for external validation, because that validation is just a show. Apple isn't the world authority on design. Be satisfied and happy with your own designs :)

What topic do you want to shoot the film on? Do you want to reach out to people? This AMA was pretty successful in that aspect :) Put up some videos on youtube, don't sweat it :)

I would definitely spend time with family, teach kids etc. I think your life would be more successful than mine will ever be, if you manage to make your peace with things :)

 How much time is left? Are you going to die soon? Or memory loss? What changes are you experiencing? 
Where exactly are you now?
 Did you abstain from meat? 


or eat it in very few quantities?  Was the 9 to 5 worth it? Have u made a will? How about a living will in the eventuality that u end up a vegetable, god forbid. Would u opt for euthanasia? 

Have u quit ur job? Did u vent out at anyone who u ever felt frustrated with?  Since nobody has asked, what's on your bucket list?
 Try brahmi . It's a cerebral vasodilator. And smoke weed for the tension :)
 I eat meat. Quite often nowadays.  Yes of course!  I will pray for you. Stay happy my friend. Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!  Dost, Ek help kar do hum sab ki. Tell us what all of us are collectively doing wrong and what actually matters. Youtube pe video daal do. Aap shayad aane wale time main bahut logo ko sahi raasta dikha sakte ho. I read most of your replies and I have an impression that you believe that your work defines who you are. Help the world brother. Show us the path. Aur agar Bangalore main ho to milo jaldi se. Sorry brother to hear that, any to do list or any path/goal ? Hey man, hope everything thing will be fine. 
Just make the most of whatever time you have left with you. Travel alone for sometime to your dream destination, spend time with people you love and tell them you love them. Live a happy life 
Hugs A warm hug to you bro!  I'm sure you'll get well soon. Kindly PM. Will love to meet you over a cup of coffee :D  Hope you are doing fine. There is no activity on your account Dude, don't panic. Try to get better first, talk to your family about this. Don't lose hope as yet. You can survive this if you take precautions and are in good care.  Visit a good doctor and start treatment. I'd suggest meanwhile join a vipassana mediation course nearby.

Why are you unhappy exactly? Is it depression or this diagnosis? And what is your age?  [deleted] You say you like music? What type of music? [removed] wish you great death don't forgot to take a selfie after death You've taken karma-whoring to another level."
